FUTURE PLANS
RACHEL: As she gains more knowlege, she finds ways to upgrade her Staff.  The mechanic would trigger at level giving her a spell to discover a goodie hut.  It would trade in the old staff and give her a new one. 

MOUSE:   Debating on whether to add the Air Trait, Air Adept, or create unique Spell Trait Path.

BOLDIN:  Fix Earth Adept so it doesn't show until a set level if possible.  

BRASHEAR: Continue to Balance his skills and damage output


Tasks prior to release
Rachel:

- Cleansing Rain.  Test duration and Crystal Cost for balance.
- Enhance recruitment quest

Mouse:
- Adjust damage for Balance as specials currently do not apply any damage reduction.
