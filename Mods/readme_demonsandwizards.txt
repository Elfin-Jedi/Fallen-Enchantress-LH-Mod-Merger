Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod runs 99% from the Mod folder, unfortunately due to a shortcoming of the way the FE:LH handles things, there is a step for copying a file to the Core folder. Don't worry it won't cause any problems and is easily removed.


Install Steps:

1) Extract all the folders to your LegendaryHeroes Mods folder, normally Documents/My Games/LegendaryHeroes/Mods.

After the zip has been extracted you should have the following:

- a folder Demons and Wizards under Mods
- a folder A_LHLIB_UnitStat_BG_vL under Mods
- a folder Demons and Wizards Gfx under Mods\Gfx
- a file called elemental.str under Mods\Data
- 2 files readme_demonsandwizards.txt and JB_DemonsWizards_Core.xml under Mods

2) Move the file JB_DemonsWizards_Core.xml (should be in Documents/My Games/LegendaryHeroes/Mods) to your Legendary Heroes\data\English folder.

Make sure you move the file, i.e. don't leave a copy in your Mods folder
The target folder will have a location like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\data\English depending on where you have your steam game files located.

3) Make sure that you turn on "Use Mods" in the in-game Options menu

Note that if you have a previous version of Demons and Wizards installed, it is highly recommended you uninstall it first.



Uninstall Steps:

1) Remove the folder Demons and Wizards from your LegendaryHeroes Mods folder
2) Remove the folder Demons and Wizards Gfx from your LegendaryHeroes Mods\Gfx folder
3) Remove the file JB_DemonsWizards_Core.xml from your FE:LH Core folder
