+++ Age of Rust

Background: Your miners are reporting a strange occurence taking place in your metal mines. Ore nodes that were previously thought viable have turned out to be practically useless. The metal looks like it has rusted even though there's no dampness or oxygen nearby. It is as if the metal has been corrupted somehow, or suffered from some kind of infection. The following years will come to be called the Age of Rust by your population.

+++ Assassinations

Background: A hidden cult of religious fanatics have performed several attacks on annual gatherings between your most ingenious researchers. None survived the attacks, and the assassins even comitted suicide after their treasonous acts. By studying their scripture you were able to determine that they believed the Cataclysm were God's Judgement on all. Therefore, to remake the world to fit your own society was the greatest sin to them. 

[[div class=\"code\"]]
Effect: It will take time to replace the researchers. For the next 25 seasons your research is reduced. It starts out being reduced by 50%, then that negative modifier is changed by 2% every season (50% then 48% then 46% and so on) until it is completely gone after 25 seasons.

+++ Deathstorm

Background: Every few thousand years, a Deathstorm appears. There does not appear to be any reason for it appearing although the philosophers have not tired of trying to understand it. It moves randomly through the world and anything touched by its rain is instantly killed - except natural objects like trees and grass. The Deathstorm ravages the countryside for a while then disappears. It is by right one of the most feared occult events in the Elemental world.

[[div class=\"code\"]]
Effect: A Deathstorm is now in the world. It covers a tile and occasionally moves. It cannot be defeated in battle and if it touches a city the city will be destroyed. The Deathstorm lasts up to 100 turns, then fades away. Its departure may be hastened by strategic damage spells, and you may also use those to try to control its movements. There is no reward for defeating or surviving the Deathstorm.

+++ Dstaurmim, the Undying

Background: In the 97th year following the Cataclysm Dstaurmim, the Hope, fought with men against the monsters of the wastes. One of the last dragons, he had sworn to protect whatever life remained in the world. Together they went into the dark places of the world, finding hideous beasts but also rich treasure they split equally. He was betrayed by the men he fought with, who sought him out in his lair when he slept and ambushed him. So great was his anger that the gates of Death could not hold him. Dstaurmim has now returned to the world, more spirit than flesh, and seeks vengeance for his passing. Although the men who killed him are long since dead, Dstaurmim's time in the afterlife has shattered his mind and he now strikes out against all living things.

[[div class=\"code\"]]

+++ Enter the Fae

Background: A combination of the waxing moon and the recent turbulence in the world of Elemental has caused the Fae to act in ever increasing amounts. Too clever or quick to be seen, their little deeds can only be noticed indirectly by observing the population. The Fae are mischievous at heart, and will use their glamour and powers of persuasion to cause chaos just for the fun of it. They'll whisper in the ears of husbands and wives and children and soldiers alike to set their minds on tasks most foul, and none may fail to heed their call. It is as if your soldiers have woken into another world, so different do your villages now seem. Your power is all but evaporated as the population take to dancing and laughing and nogoodery.

Lucius spent his days finding witches where there were none to be found, and without his knowledge he had become more feared by the farmers than the witches he seeked to burn. Lucius believed that the fire would burn away all sins. One day, Lucius happened upon a real witch that he attempted to burn. Alas, witches do not burn as well as humans do, so when Lucius stood next to the fire reciting his holy texts to supress the witch, the witch stepped out of the fire and threw him into it, shouting \"Now YOUR sins will burn!\".
