    <Description>The Angels were once servants of their God, but were cast out as they failed to prevent the Cataclysm. Now, having lost the ability to fly, they seek to return to the grace of their God.
	    
The Angels were a divine race, granted the utmost love and compassion of their god, whom they lived with at the Mountain of the Gods. They spent their days pondering philosophical quandaries and praying to their lord, and playing different games that required them to fly around. When the Titans arrived to the Elemental world, the Angels were sent as agents of a higher power to influence the turn of events against the Titans. Their god gave them this task to keep magic flowing freely in the world. However, the Angels failed their god twice. First, the Titans managed to capture the magic in the shards, and second, the world was destroyed in the Cataclysm. Their god blamed the Angels for both these events, and so, the Angels were cast out from the Mountain of the Gods, no longer in their god's grace. The Angels lost the ability to fly, their wings now useless without the guiding hand of their god.
	
	Despite being so abandoned by their god, the current Angel society is fiercely fanatical. Rather than turn on their god for his betrayal, they believe that the Angels can work their way back into the god's good grace and then return to the Mountain of the Gods. But far from remaining the same society that they had before the Cataclysm, the Angels have undergone a great change in recent years. Their leader, the Angel of Hope, Colopatiron, has learned how to acess the magic stored in the shards, and now uses it to empower the Angel race much like their god used to do before. When this was discovered, there was a schism in their religion that quickly transformed it in its entirety. They now call this progress the "New Faith". Profoundly magical in their essence, they have taken to using shards like no other race ever has or ever will on the face of the Elemental world.  Despite this, not a single Angel has to this day mentioned the possibility that perhaps they do not need their god.</Description>
    <LorebookIntroText>TBA.

		Here lie the ruins of the Athican Empire - the greatest of all the kingdoms of men.

Evidence of that vanished realm are everywhere; broken stones which were once part of the old Lord Protectors' Road; patches of grassland that once served as breadbasket to the peoples of Coriopolis.

There is life here still; dense forests, and verdant swamplands. Merchants, miners, and farmers struggle to eak out existence. The right man could weave these disparate threads into a kingdom once more.

Yet there are dangers as well. Great expanses of wildlands, where all manner of creatures - natural and unnatural - roam free.

And there are rumors of fouler evil still rising in the east. To some those rumors are just empty words. But to you, [LeaderName], they are a truth foolish to deny.</LorebookIntroText>
