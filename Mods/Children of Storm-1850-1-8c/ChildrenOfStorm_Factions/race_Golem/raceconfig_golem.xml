		<Description>The Golem faction consists primarily of White Golems made by the White Wizard many thousand years ago. They are partially made out of souls of sacrificed humans. They also have a small amount of dust in them taken from the magical shards, and have shown great resistance to magic.

Throughout the years, there have been many magicians and wizards who made for themselves golems to serve. But none created more than the The White Wizard, who lived before the Titans came. To him, they replaced servants, family and friends. But because they did so, he lived his life as a boy, his golems shouldering all duty. As he passed on, he had not a thought for the fate of his creations. Left without a master, no more golems were made and they had no purpose. Performing their tasks, they spread across the world and did strange things, trying to find meaning in every word their creator had said, looking for meaning in implications, subtexts, and chiffers. But there was none to be had. The White Wizard lived the life of a genuis, but he died as young in his mind as he ever was. 

After many years, when the golems had grown few, and had changed in many ways, another man took pity on these machinations walking in his lands. His name was Diego, and he cared for these golems that wandered the land but didn't think for themselves. And though he laboured all his life to repair golems he found, and attempted to create ways for them to reproduce, his life was by any human standards wasted. But the golems had watched him labour, as much as Diego had watched them. And by discussing and analyzing the life of Diego, whom the golems had thought of as friend, they at last found the solution to their problems. They saw in Diego what no golem had ever understood - that to live is to love, and want, and sacrifice, and make your own fate. Not to mindlessly serve based on instructions from others. So the golems set about to find their own fate. And the first of these were Lochean, who gathered all the golems together, and through channeling again could create more. 

The history of the golems is commonly depicted in their cities in various ornaments. There, the White Wizard sits on a rug, held aloft by perfectly identical golems - they call him Maker. And there Diego lies dead on the ground, tools scattered around him, with the many different golems watching him - they call him Father. And at last, Lochean, with both arms raised to the skies, as if to challenge the future, with golems lined up behind him nearing infinity - they call him Brother.

The golems that followed Lochean into true sentience all share a common characteristic - in their presence, magic is very weak. It is believed that this occurs due to how the golems were - and are - made, with some magical dust sprinkled into the golem at creation. Some say the dust is made out of broken shards, although that is unlikely since the shards didn't exist on Elemental when the White Wizard lived.</Description>
