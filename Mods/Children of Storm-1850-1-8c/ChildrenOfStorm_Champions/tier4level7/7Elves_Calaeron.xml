		<DisplayName>Calaeron</DisplayName>
		<Backstory>While most elves keep to the deep woods, some feel the call of the seas, and Calaeron was raised by one such group who dwelt near the shores.  In his younger days he had studied the magical arts but at the time of the events known as the Cataclysm, Calaeron, tired of academic pursuits, had taken up the sailor's life and was sailing far from home.  When, after many delays and misadventures resulting from the chaos of the magical upheval, his badly damaged vessel was finally able to return home, the crew found that the entire city had been swept into the sea.  They travelled on, and eventually put into the barely surviving remains of a port town controlled by what would become the nation of Krax.  Their vessel was confiscated, and the crew, much dispirited, dispersed.  Calaeron himself determined to make his way back to other elves, but was delayed for many years when he was entrapped by a Fallen sorceror who wished to study his immortal nature. Unable to escape his magical confinement, Caleaeron spent most of the time in silent meditation, much to the consternation of the sorceror.  Luckily for Calaeron, it seems the sorceror never suspected Calaeron's great magical powers, or else the tortures and experimentation he was subjected to from time to time would surely have been much worse. 

Recently his captor died of old age, releasing Calaeron from his imprisonment.  Continuing his former journey, he eventually came into contact with the remainder of the elves but discovered that his people have changed in their outlook, which he finds disturbing. Further, none of the seafaring elves he knew are among them.  After a period in which he wandered aimlessly along the shore in solitude, Calaeron has decided to find a group to belong to again.</Backstory>
