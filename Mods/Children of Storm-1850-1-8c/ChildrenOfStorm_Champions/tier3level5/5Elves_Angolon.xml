		<DisplayName>Angolon the Dark Elf</DisplayName>
		<Backstory>The Cataclysm affected Angolon differently than other elves.  While most elves see the damage caused by those times as a cause for grief, Angolon instead saw the change as a chance to break with the old traditions and dependencies on nature's capricious cycles, to overturn the old taboos, and to build a new, modern elvish nation.  Initially he tried convincing others, but as each in turn gave him reactions ranging from apathetic depression to outright disgust, he grew embittered.  More and more, he kept away from other elves, and even made travels into nearby Fallen towns in search of new options and kindred spirits.

As he continued his pursuit of new ways to build a modern elvish nation, he came into contact with a sorcerer who claimed that he could show Angolon new methods that would prove to the other elves the efficacy of his ideas.  Under the tutelage of this sorcerer, Angolon pursued research into the technologies and magics introduced by the titans.  Eventually, the sorcerer revealed himself as a demon, and indicated that Angolon would need to choose whether to continue on the path that they had started, or to end their arrangement. He gladly accepted the demon's offer of continued training; in exchange, he would only have to embed a sliver of a death shard into the oldest oak in his home forest.  Thinking that nothing could be more easy, Angolon quickly returned to the grove of his elders and accomplished the feat.  As soon as he did so, a great change came over that section of forest, and it began to shrivel and die before his eyes.  Other elves soon came rushing up, then fell to their knees, sobbing, as they witnessed the change. By this point, Angolon felt nothing but disdain for his own kind, like a noble among lesser beings. He smirked as he walked past his stunned kinsfolk out of the grove, never to return.

Upon returning to the study where he had left the demon sorcerer, he found that his tutor had departed, leaving behind only a sealed scroll.  Angolon broke the seal and studied the contents.  Eventually, he decided to recite the incantation within.  No sooner was the incantation completed than the scroll evaporated in a burst of green flames.  He felt a strange pull at his body, as if he were somehow being stretched...and then, nothing, except a strange pit of emptiness.  He soon discovered, however, that there was a physical manifestation of the event; his skin is now as dark as his soul.</Backstory>
