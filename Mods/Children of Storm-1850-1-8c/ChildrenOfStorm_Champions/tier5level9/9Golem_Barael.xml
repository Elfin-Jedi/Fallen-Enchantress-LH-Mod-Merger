		<Backstory>At one point, Lochean, the golem leader of the White Golems, determined that it would be more expedient to destroy certain golems than to attempt to "convert" them. To that end, he created several new golems with special training in the destruction of other golems. As a safety precaution, they were not given free will, but instead were bound solely to Lochean's command. This was done in secret, for obvious reasons.  Barael was one of these specially created golems.

During one mission to destroy some iron golems being utilized by a group of Ironeers, Barael was severely damaged.  In fact, he was mistakenly reported as destroyed by the rest of his attack force; this, however, was not the case. In a later raid by conventional White Golem forces, Barael's body was discovered in a wrecked building and recovered for repair and treatment.  As part the repairs, the golem restoring him, unaware of his special purpose and secret nature, ended up granting Barael self-control and free will.  

After his recovery, Barael, disillusioned with the cause espoused by Lochean and the White Golems, took it upon himself to destroy the rest of his former unit, a task that he has successfully completed. So far as Barael is aware, Lochean has not seen fit to create another such clandestine group, though he has heard that the White Golems have authorized some units of golems to learn special disassembly tactics officially.

His point made, Barael now seeks to place his skills at the disposal of a new employer, though he has no illusions as to moral superiority; he merely seeks a competent leader to work with.</Backstory>
