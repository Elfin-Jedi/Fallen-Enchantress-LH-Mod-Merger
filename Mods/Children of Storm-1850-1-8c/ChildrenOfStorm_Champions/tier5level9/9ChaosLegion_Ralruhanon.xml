		<Backstory>Somehow, during their flight from the dungeon dimensions, Ralruhanon was changed.  She had previously been a unit commander of especially bloodthirsty shock troops, unswerving in her loyalty to the No-God.  The loss of her leader left her shaken to her core.  She decided to take stock.  When she and the decimated remains of her unit fled through the gate, instead of re-forming them into a coherent fighting unit on the other side, she walked silently away, through the swirling chaos, out into the wilderness.  There, on her own for the first time since birth, she pondered the meaning of her existence.  After many weeks, amidst struggling to survive the various hostile forces roaming the lands, she came to the conclusion that she, and indeed her entire race, were in the wrong, did not belong to this world, and should depart immediately.  Struggling to deal with the heretofore unfamiliar feelings of remorse, she applied what she knew and was born to; she decided to fight.  This time, however, she would fight against her people.  That this effort will likely lead to her own demise does not bother her.  She is no fool, however, and now seeks an army to fight alongside.</Backstory>
