			<Backstory>I am Kurshk. Have you not heard of me?  That is no surprise, for I am selective when it comes to associates - I prefer to maintain the company of only those who can be relied upon for discretion. Nonetheless, I am known and respected in certain circles - those who seek the dangerous creatures of the wild for sport, rather than profit or protection. Some who hunt seek trophies of their kills, tokens to prove their skill to those who doubt them; I have no need of these, for I am secure in the knowledge of my own skill, and I remember each kill vividly.

Recently, though, I have come to realize that there may be a more worthy prey.  I speak, of course, of the kind that travels on two legs. I understand that you may be seeking those who can undertake this kind of hunt, so I place myself at your disposal. I trust you will remain discreet?</Backstory>

			<Backstory>When I was a girl, a trader came to our village and tried to sell us various things while passing through on his route between larger outposts. His carts were full of useless trinkets and baubles, fancy cloth, vials of perfume and the like. He quickly determined that we had no use for such things. Then it was that he revealed that he had weapons, too, hidden beneath the rest. Unfortunately for him, these were shoddy things, poorly made by some farmers' smith with no concept of true weaponcraft. What before had been apathy and disinterest from my tribe's people turned to anger, for a poorly made weapon can mean the difference between life and death in battle. 

He determined to make his departure, but as he did, I noticed that he had a selection of books packed in with the weapons. I informed him that I would purchase these from him. He turned to me, and saw a girl, a villager with rough clothes, a Trog. He sniffed and said that these were not for "my kind", and then had the temerity to hand me a dagger and ask what I'd give for that instead. I hamstrung him with it, and then took the books. I do not believe that he ever reached his intended destination.

What I want, I will pay for, in gildar or in steel.  Haggling is for those merchant dogs like the Kraxians and their ilk.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>So you have heard that tales that others tell of my people? That we are the product of some magical miscegenation between humans and dragons, demons, shrills and devil knows what else? I cannot say the truth of it, but I do know that certain of my people have an uncanny way with the dangerous creatures of the wild. I am one of these.  Perhaps this is what drives my...unusual passions.  

Be that as it may, you may be assured that my inclinations will not adversely impact your troops or impair my service.  I can exhibit supreme control when necessary, even if I relish moments of abandon in periods of leisure.  If you would deign to turn over captured forces to me from time to time, however, I and my...pets...have uses for them.

On the other hand, if you'd care to join me in...no?  As I said, you have nothing to fear from my recreational pursuits.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>Perhaps you could say that once I was a simple woodsman - but there are no simple woodsmen in these times. Even something as mundane as cutting timber risks attack by fell beasts, bandits, or bands of the Fallen, renegade or otherwise.  No, there's nothing simple about it, and even the least of us go armed and ready to defend ourselves.  Even still, there was a time that I was just another woodcutter.  That was before...before I heard the voice of the land.

No, I am not a madman, though some have called me so.  But I can feel the mood of the forests and fields, sense when they are healthy and bursting with life, and also when there is some evil threatening them, or if the dark power of the Cataclysm's withering still holds sway.  Sometimes I hear it as a voice, hard to distinguish from my own.  And always, when I do, that voice implores me to act, to drive out whatever is threatening the land.

It was this voice that led me to attack a plaguebeast that had made its lair in the woods near my village.  It was this voice that spoke to me when my village would soon be overtaken by wildfire, so that I could warn my people and save what we could.  Now some call me a hero, and perhaps I am, though I did not set out to become one.  But here I am before you, where this voice has directed me to come.  So far, it has not led me astray.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>Perhaps you're more familiar with Capitar's nobles or my people's merchants? That's not surprising; we range far and wide, we Mancer folk. And they say that there's a daughter of one or another of our nobles tucked away in the ladies' chamber, or a son squiring for the lord, in most of the kingdoms and duchies that are fit to speak to, and some that aren't. But then, that's not my story, no. No, for every posh lady in waiting or pimply squire, there's a gutter rat like own self running about, making life hell for any merchant with the lack of sense to leave their wares on display and out of their  arms' reach. I lived with the dogs and woke with the fleas, but a happier young rascal than I was you've never met. Hungry times, though.

Still doesn't explain me here, though, does it? Now that, you see, is down to luck. There's an annual footrace held in the center of town; draws all the surrounding villagers in to watch, which I expect's the reason for it.  Anyway, I've always been quick, and a couple years ago I managed to win; seems that for some reason all the local dogs kept tripping up the other runners, heh. Brought me to the attention of a merchant, who gave me some equipment and hired me on as a guard, mostly at first for the celebrity aspect I reckon.  While travelling, though, she noticed I have a talent for keeping the horses in line, calming the livestock, that kind of thing.  For the first time I was appreciated, and the feeling was mutual - I'd be with her today, if I could.  But last year she was travelling with her caravan and was lost, and her merchant house disbanded to settle debts; so here I am, mercenary in the making.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>One must always consider the cost of overcaution when planning for any risky endeavour.  While leaving oneself unguarded is clearly a fool's maneuver, it is also true that an effective defense must be an active one.  Many times it is the effective counterattack thrust into the underbelly of the aggressor that carries the day. 

Who am I to make such observations?  Yes, I am of noble birth, but my family's power and influence is insufficient to secure my own place in the world, let alone to change things on our own. I am merely an interested party...but one who seeks to better his own position. We must not be slow to take advantage of opportunities presented, and every gain must be held tenaciously, every contingency prepared for.  I am willing to serve and help ensure that you convert your every potential chance into realized advances, and thereby advance my own fortunes in the process.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>You may have heard from others that I am "insubordinate". I ask - is it insubordination for the natural leader to lead? My people were born to be soldiers, born to follow, born to die at others' command without question. I reject that folly; unlike them, I will choose my own destiny. For now it suits me to fight under your banner, but just because that furthers my own ambitions, do not think me a servant or slave to order about. Do not mistake my words to mean that I follow the same creed of "freedom for all" as those foolhardy rebels in the kingdoms of men. The strong and talented, such as we, should dictate their inferiors' actions. This is only natural.</Backstory>

			<NPCRecruitmentText>I can be of service. If you wish to hire me for %d gildar.</NPCRecruitmentText>
			<Backstory>Do you hear that sound, faint, on the edge of the wind? The pack is hunting tonight, and their howls beckon to me. No, no, I am not one of the half-beasts of tales, bound to the moon's call. I do feel a kinship with the beasts of the wild, however- the glory of their single-minded pursuit of their prey, their supreme focus and sudden frenzy of attack. We of the D'rog know a similar sensation in battle; the lust for blood can overtake us. It was bred into us by the ones who came before, the titans of the beforetimes. I feel that call, I understand it - but I choose not to let it overwhelm me. Yes, there is power in fury, but there is also power in control; the trick is to know when best to use each. This is a thing too subtle for many of my people, though most of the great ones know it.

Nonetheless, to feel the call of the hunt, the chase, of battle waged - and to know that your opponent fears you, that your presence sets them aquiver with doubt and trepidation - this is a fine thing. And as the wolf has no pity for the hare, so too do I hold those who quail before me in contempt. Let them turn, let them flee and be chased down. Or let them come at me; it makes no difference, for they are only the prey, while I am the hunter.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>They say my people were once gladiator slaves that threw off Capitar's chains and that this was the beginning of the kingdom of Tarth. That was long before my day, though. I was born in a remote farming outpost, far from that kingdom, and we had Tarth, Capitar, Krax, and any number of minor kingdoms and duchies lay claim to us. Then they'd forget, because there was nothing of value nearby, so we'd be left to our own devices when some rampaging beastie from the wildlands came through. Every child among us learned to hold a spear or club as soon as they could be trusted to walk upright as a matter of survival. Eventually we tired of the pretences of the various factions and started fending off all comers, no matter their banner. That worked for a time.

Ultimately, though, some Quendar slavers caught wind of us, far from the protection of any army. They found a sorceror to cast dark magics on the village that weakened our defenders, left us feeling as if we were in the throes of some horrible disease. It eventually wore off but by that time all of us were either dead or in shackles. That day I lost both my parents in the fighting, and two younger brothers who were too young to travel so the Quendar put them to the sword.  I counted fourteen summers to my name then, and spent the next three toiling for the Quendar in their fields, cursing them every day.

One day a different master came through, looking for fodder to use the in arenas. For some reason she decided that I looked worthy, so I was taken from the fields and carted to a stinking arena slave pen in the city. We were meant to die, but for the sake of appearance they gave us each a club or spear, then turned us into the battle pit. Perhaps it was luck, or perhaps there's something to that story of gladiator blood, but I survived that day, and the next. At that point the master decided that I was worth preserving, so I was given training and somewhat better equipment. I kept surviving and eventually became somewhat known as a spoiler. I never made a great name for myself in the pits, though, as what they hadn't counted on was the other side of that Tarthan blood - the part about revolting. One day the arena master decided that it was time to give me my own insignia, and to have me fitted for custom armor. I never got to see it, though, because when she sent the guard to retrieve me, I was able to wrest away his weapon and defeat him, as well as the one on watch who rushed to help. I quickly opened some of the other pens but surprisingly, only a few were willing to come with me. Truly, some people's chains are stronger than iron. The small band of escapees and myself made it to the countryside, but I was unable to locate the remnants of my village. We did, however, do some serious damage raiding the outskirts of the Quendar settlements for the next few months, living off the land for what we could not plunder. After that we broke apart and went our separate ways. Myself, I've taken to periodically recruiting new parties of adventure seekers and harassing the greyskins' settlements; I'm proud to say that I've freed threescore slaves, aside from those in the pits. 

I've come to see, though, that it's not enough. We need to begin a push in earnest to set things right, to settle things now and forever. I think you're the one who'll do that, so here I am, ready to help.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>When I was a boy I had great dreams of becoming a field commander, valiantly leading the charge as my men and I streaked across the battlefield to vanquish the timorous forces of the enemy. Nothing more glamorous than that, eh? But as I grew older, more and more I saw the sad truth that there are two sides to a conflict, that those 'timorous' opponents generally fight back, and that battlefield encounters tend to leave the participants much the worse for wear. So, bright lad that I was, I determined that it would be best to assume a more distant role, one where I could still observe the effects of my strategy unfolding without necessarily getting wrapped up in its immediate (and dangerous) consequences. This, in turn, led to the discovery that entire armies can be summoned and fielded by those with the power to call them forth, thereby buffering not only oneself, but one's entire army from the up close and personal threat presented by, say, a Trog axeman in your face. To this end, I have pursued the art of magical force augmentation - both enhancing the abilities of existing forces, as well as calling forth reinforcements from magical realms. If I say so myself, I have attained some skill in this arena.

Of course, the ultimate test is to put those forces into play. Not that I agitate or advocate for unwarranted action - but surely, now is the time when all forces martial may be brought to bear, to ensure that those who would impose their tyranny upon us are thwarted? Yes, indubitably there will be many terrible battles ahead in the coming days, terrible, and yet glorious, and I would play my part in that. From a well secured position, naturally.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>Hrmm...ah, yes, this is a fine example of foliage from the rare Mettlewit bush, also known, alas, as Stinkberry. When crushed and brewed, it makes an infusion said to stimulate the mind, though few can tolerate the odor. But forgive me, that is not what we came here to discuss. No, I am here today to discuss the state of affairs in the capital.  To put it bluntly, there are some individuals in positions of power whose goals do not align with the needs of the kingdom. While none rise to the level of treason, their self-interested actions have detracted from the focus necessary in these times of turmoil. I have taken the liberty to prepare a list of actions to mitigate the influence of these troublemakers; I am confident that if pursued, we can achieve much greater efficiency in the coming season.

Also, on a lighter note, I am pleased to report that after implementing my suggestion, we have been able to cultivate a supply of useful medicinal herbs, roots, and berries on the crown estates, and that sales of such have made a significant contribution to the treasury. If you would like me to pursue this course of action further, I am sure that I can locate cultivatable supplies of additional varieties given time and the backing of a small expedition.  Of course, I understand that the exigencies of state may not allow for such at this time, but if we could act now, we could ensure that we maintain a position as exclusive suppliers of these otherwise hard to obtain supplies.</Backstory>

			<NPCRecruitmentText>I can be of service. If you wish to hire me for %d gildar.</NPCRecruitmentText>
			<Backstory>The problem with most rulers and administrators is that they are unwilling to use the full panoply of tools at their disposal. Myself, I have no such qualms. Propaganda, poison, blackmail, intimidation, bribery - each of these has its place, and I have used them all. This is not to say that one should neglect the more palatable aspects of leadership where feasible - no; the key is to mix them in the proper proportions so that you maintain a constant advantage. For instance - if a petty noble plots against you, one should not merely have them executed; at once, their kin should be detained as leverage and to discourage flight. When they are apprehended they should be interrogated and tortured so as to determine their co-conspirators and the state of their planning. Their assets should be seized and and impounded, forfeit as penalty for their treason. Their plans should be publicly exposed as foolhardy, transparent, and doomed to failure, so as to discourage imitators. And so forth, and so on, with any other traitors, et cetera.

I find that this applies equally well when more personal command situations are called for; when you know the proper motivating force for a man, you can ensure prompt action in even the most strenuous circumstance. For some with a more mercenary bent, gildar or luxuries are enough to ensure their absolute loyalty. For conscripts and militia, the threat of retribution against family can work wonders. In some cases, especially among those who fancy themselves heroes, a carefully groomed ego can be used to push them to actions that a more rational individual would never consider.

Of course, one needs the strength of mind to back all of these intertwining streams, and that's where I excel. This is not pride; this is fact. At any given time I have thought several steps ahead of my rivals and set contingencies in motion to cover any change in circumstance. I think of it as something akin to shadows shifting in the light; any one of them could be cast by the true form but it's hard to be sure of which. As proof, you see me before you today. If I were less adept, someone else would no doubt be standing in my place. Never fear, though; I have no plans to vacate my post any time soon.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>It's a fool who fights a fair fight. Now, as I see it, the foremost priority is to strike your opponent before they can strike you. The thrown knife and reach of a spear are excellent at maintaining your distance from your opponent; a dose of sharpened steel to the face before you're even in retaliation range does wonders to discourage. If you can't knock them down before they close, try to strike them from behind someone else. Doesn't matter who, so long as they're not more dangerous than the ones you're jabbing with your spear. With luck and good timing, you can skewer several of them with one well placed thrust.

If you want to make all of that even more effective you can line up ranks of trained pikemen, shoulder to shoulder. Me, though, I like to keep myself open and mobile so I can dart in and pick points of vulnerability, or twist out of the way of opponents' thrusts. Doesn't fit in well with closed ranks, kind of like how I don't fit in well with your typical military chain of command. Now, I'm not saying I can't work with soldiers; in fact, I'm sure I could show your troops a thing or two - just don't tell me what colors I need to wear, how I should make my bedroll, or, demons take us, try to serve me any of that army slop they call rations.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>There was a time when I, too, thought that there could be peace between the Fallen and ourselves, that while we may not see eye to eye, surely a diplomatic resolution could allow for coexistence...but that was before. Before those things that I wish I had never seen, never known, those memories that drive my fears and actions. But alas, there can be no ultimate accommodation. Our goals are mutually exclusive, our ideologies anathema to each other. Do you know what I observed to change my opinion in this way?

I was raised a merchant's son, and when I reached the age of majority, although I had little mercantile inclination and had instead undertaken magical tutelage, per my family's tradition I was given my own caravan to lead (albeit with my uncle as advisor.) As an excuse to see the world, I chose an ambitious route through many lands, including those under the sway of Krax and even a bit into Resoln, despite my family's reservations. Our expedition was at first uneventful other than the usual hazards of bandits, wild beasts, and the like. Our guards easily fended these off, and so we continued into the lands of the Fallen. Curiously, I noted, the very land itself appeared to change as we journeyed on. The vegetation was more subdued and less vibrant in color, the sound of birds changed from pleasant songs to harsh cries; even the skies seemed to grow darker. Thinking it but a quirk of the season or local habitat I set it aside, but it remained in my mind, nagging. The Kraxian people, at least, seemed normal enough, albeit a bit more grim, a shade less lively, a touch less willing to laugh at a joke. I grimaced at their openly conducted slavery (we of course did not accept any in trade), but we traveled on.

When we reached the outskirts of Resoln, the land changed still more. Now there was an eerie stillness, and the only wildlife I observed was the occasional carrion bird, watching us intently. Where in Krax the plants had been of unusual hue, now they were altogether alien, with dark foliage, sharp thorns, and often covered in growths of fungus or mold. The sky was constantly clouded, and while it was only early fall, chill winds would spring up. Some of our pack animals grew ill after drinking from a stream; they seemed to wither and die before our eyes in only a day. Luckily none of our men had drunk, but nonetheless we observed a sickly pallor overtaking our party. After consulting with my uncle we determined to turn back after trading with the first sizable settlement. If only we had turned back at these first warnings...

The next day we reached the city, set up, and began trading. It was curious; while our goods sold quickly, the people did little haggling, giving us dark and and angry glances. It was as if we had something of theirs that they begrudged having to pay for. The city, too, was strange. There was little of the commotion and noise one would expect; the wraiths hurried from place to place or stood grimly in their places. And wraiths they seemed indeed, with their pallid skin, dark, shadowy fashions, and terse manner. And then, I saw one of them lead away a pig that we had just sold. He went a short way across the square and called to a young wraith girl. She looked frail and sickly, even for their kind. He knelt her next to the animal and placed her hand on it. And then...the horror...her hands glowed and the pig fell over, stone dead. At this, she looked straight at me, where I no doubt stood aghast, mouth open. She grinned a wicked smile, stood up, and curtsied to me, her frailty gone. I quickly glanced about the square and saw that were other such incidents. My blood ran cold. I glanced back to the man and the girl, but they had gone, leaving the pig's corpse in the square. A raven flew in from the edge of the square and began pecking at its remains, already strangely decayed. We did not stay the night but left as soon as our goods were sold; we would have left sooner, but I feared the reaction.

No, there can be no lasting peace between our kinds. At least not without following those like the Kraxians on their transition toward depravity.
Perhaps you think you are ready, that you're prepared for whatever may come? You're wrong. Oh, you may think you know what you're facing, that the Fallen are just men with grey complexions. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Where we have pity, empathy, compassion and kindness, they have only a cold, ruthless pit of evil. I know your objections; you think that perhaps I exaggerate? The times of the titans are past? Yes, I acknowledge that the titans are gone. But the Fallen who remain share their corrupting spirit. They are alien, a people wholly unlike us, and left unchecked they will remake the world to suit them. Even the very earth and vegetation around their settlements changes in some horrible, cruel mockery of its former nature, reflecting their twisted essences.

Take the Trogs; everyone knows that they are fierce warriors, but they have among them those they call Juggernauts, huge raging beasts barely recognizable as sentient - and yet they consign their own children to endure lives of torture, foul rites, and brutal animosity in order to create them. Or the Wraiths of Resoln; I myself have witnessed a ritual where an alien spirit is summoned into the still living body of a youth, consuming them in the process, merely to create powerful servitor. Oh yes, they have twisted even elementals in their service. And it is said that the diplomats of the Fallen empires negotiate again with the former servants of the titans to ally with them; are you prepared to face armies of man-eating ogres, trolls, and their kin, as in the long ago days leading to the Cataclysm? And what of the Kraxians? If anything, they serve as a cautionary example. Whatever unholy bargains they have made have imperiled their very souls. You can feel it in their town and cities, a sense of oppression, despair, and growing madness. I fear that in time, they too will become as unrecognizable as the rest of the Fallen.

I, however, am ready. I have studied the enemy in their own lands, observing points of weakness, and devising means to overcome them. Let me share these insights with you so that we may prepare, and perhaps we may yet overcome the encroaching tide of evil.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>Of course, I am sure that you're more concerned with the potential threat to your kingdom and your subjects, but surely you can recognize that in war it's not just people that get hurt. No, the rampaging hordes of the Fallen marching across the land represent a threat to the birds and beasts of the wild, the fields, forests, and streams, indeed the very land itself. Where they pass, there is chaos and death, destruction and decay. We must stand guard to ensure that this does not happen, that the progress that has been made in recovering the land since the days of the titans and the Cataclysm is not lost.

You may well ask - what good to me is a rabbit in the wild, an untilled stretch of land, or a wolf hunting far from civilization? I would answer that these things are all linked. A tract of natural growth spreads and encourages the barren lands to become fertile again, which may someday become suitable for settlement. The rabbits graze and fertilize the wildlands, so that they are not overrun with the strange weeds one sees in the lands where the Fallen hold sway. The wolves, in turn, keep the rabbits in check. Of course, this is but a simple example, and there are many more connections beside, but my point is that all of these things are important and worth defending. Since that happens to coincide with your goal of preserving your kingdom, that is clearly grounds for our cooperation. Indeed, you may find that the creatures of the wild, more than just your wards, become your allies.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>I tire of the talk one hears in the camps about the weakness of mankind. We should act, strike quickly, and sow dismay among their ranks. They rightly fear us; I say let us give their fear form.  For myself, I have waited long enough for the chance to revenge myself upon them.

Yes, I say revenge, for I owe the race of man a blood debt. My brothers were killed by cowards who set fire to our encampment, rather than face us in honourable combat. I would recognize the face of the one who led them, though I don't know what banner he fights for. It is no matter, for the debt incurred they must repay many-fold and one of the stinking cowards' heads will not meet the price. I would burn their fields, sack their cities, see their children in chains. Let me loose my fury on them; I promise you a river of blood deep enough to drown them in their dread.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>I've never understood why so many self-styled "battlemages" think that for some reason they can wear nothing but some brightly colored robe and their skivvies, brandish the nearest available quarterstaff, and then proceed onto the field of battle without getting pin-cushioned by enemy archers. They might as well shout out "Hello, I'm a magician; pray fire all your bows at me first!" I'd much rather outfit myself sensibly for battle and have a trusty hammer at my side to bash in the skull of any fool who manages to break through the lines to reach me. Also, hammers come in handy while setting up your bivouac.

Similarly, too many magicians want to do everything themselves. "Please refrain from attacking for a few minutes while I carefully set myself up to blanket you all in lethally inclement weather" is not the way to conduct oneself in a military engagement. One needs to work with the forces at hand. Now, have no fear; I can rain down the arcane death upon my foes when necessary. That said, things work out so much more satisfactorily when the sword fodder (sorry, I meant 'new recruits') can conduct their mad rush at the enemy with magically sharpened steel, or when the fearless and heavily armored knight over there can be imbued with the strength of an ogre. The wit, alas, he has already...anyway, once you've equipped your allies to successfully engage the enemy, coincidentally bearing the brunt of their retaliation, you're much more able to sit back and selectively target any troublesome targets with your magical volleys.

Ah well. In the meantime, let us proceed to decimate the forces of those who lack my practical nature.</Backstory>

			<Quote>'I would rid the world of men, for I prefer the company of the wild creatures of this land.'</Quote>
			<NPCRecruitmentText>I can be of service. If you wish to hire me for %d gildar.</NPCRecruitmentText>
			<Backstory>You think me a traitor to my own kind? Perhaps...but I have suffered nothing but betrayal from my own. My mother was a courtesan once, and then later, after she fell into disfavor, a simple prostitute. She never informed me of my father's name, and he never sought me out. As for her, she had no great love for me; she sold me as a slave to a sorcerer while I was still quite young. I have no idea if she yet lives, though I expect not, for she was addicted to a drug that wastes first the mind, then eventually the body.

My master recognized what she could not - he saw in me an inner magical talent that he could harness. It was no kindness of his, though, that led him to develop that in me. No, I was the vessel for his experimentation, a means for control of the beastly beings he summoned. He would call them forth for his benefit while I would pay the price, my body serving as host for the duration of their transitory existence in this world. Fortunately for me he was incapable of the kind of permanent binding rumored to take place in the lands of Resoln. Eventually I escaped and ran into the deserted regions beyond civilization, where I discovered that the experience had granted me a certain...affinity...with the beasts of the wild. I survived there and grew my power. Eventually I returned to my former master seeking my revenge, but I found his residence destroyed and deserted. He had already been devoured by some demon or another; it seems he had had grown too used to my assistance in controlling them. I picked what was useful from his belongings and left unsatisfied.

Why, then, do I come seeking employment? Just because I understand and have a degree of control over wild creatures and beings from beyond does not mean that I am one. I enjoy creature comforts, from time to time. There will be enough for me, though, in the spoils of your conquests, and if wolves run through the streets of the sacked cities of mankind left in your wake, I will shed no tears. Wolves are at least loyal.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>There is a strange lesson I learned, as I studied with the arcane. The more proficient with it I became, the less significant my self became. On those rare occasions when I meet others skilled with magic, it surprises me to see them still prideful, or fearful. Have they not graduated? What are we, but vessels to this power that allows us to use it?

Perhaps I have rambled. Know that even if my tale is folly, I serve you loyally, so long as your aim is to restore Life to this world.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>You seek to show the world just how strong you are, do you not? Well you cannot afford to tolerate those who would raise arms against you. 

So let me dance, and cut into your enemies. The art I practice is well honed, and where I strike, death quickly sets in its eternal grip. From these hands, death celebrates outward at my lyrical command. Will you not direct me, where to next perform? I shall make such sublime opera, wherever your enemies dare still breathe.</Backstory>

I rarely feel joy, save for when Fallen soldiers march well, and obey resolutely. I feel it again, when peasants and laborers do what they are told, quickly and without question.

And finally, I feel joy when men look upon the weapon in my hand with terror.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>So many of my kind feel that death must come quickly. But this is folly! I wait in battle. I stand while others fall. They are slow when I am like clockwork. I breathe, while my opponent is exhausted and drained. It is then that I strike out, hitting them where they are weak, and making their vitality my meal.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>Have you ever seen a Trog fight? Oh, it is quite beautiful, if you do not find yourself the target of their fury. Their rage is so singular, and focused, that even a sickly, weak Trog would challenge the ferocity of a vigorous soldier.

What we can learn from Trogs - what separates us from them - is to know when fury is not needed. We men, who are weaker, yes, are nonetheless stronger in spirit. I know this, because my mind has cleaved Trogs when my body would have failed me. Under your command, I shall glady cut Fallen flesh once more.</Backstory>

			<Backstory>Have you ever watched the shadows? When bright light suddenly assails the dark, it shrinks and evades with a transcendent skill. 

My friend, I have watched the shadows for long, long hours. The shadow is strong and confident when the light is absent. When brightness chases it away, it evades with skill, and is resolute in taking its chance to return. 

I can tell you more of the shadows, and how best to slay its servants.</Backstory>

			<Quote>'I grows tired of pretenders.  I am strong and loyal, but unimpressed by men who call themselves leaders.  I wonder... if you are just another pretender?'</Quote>
			<NPCRecruitmentText>I can be of service. If you wish to hire me for %d gildar.</NPCRecruitmentText>
			<Backstory>It is the curse of these days, after the Cataclysm, that all things fade quickly. Flesh, crops, great plans - they all can break at a moment's notice. Order is still new here. 

But some can outlast the decay. The leaders who will end the period of chaos will stand firm against ill faith and broken promises. They will keep their word even when the crops die, and the people wail. Recruit me, and I shall keep my promises to you, and labor to ensure your word, as well, holds true.</Backstory>
