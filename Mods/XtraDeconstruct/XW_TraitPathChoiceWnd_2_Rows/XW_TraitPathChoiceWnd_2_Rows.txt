0. Preamble

	IMPORTANT:
	If your LH installation is in a custom directory instead of the default directory, you will have (resolvable) issues w/ DXPACK files.
	For more information, see "T2. (Others) - Troubleshooting, Known Issues, Knowledge Base, and FAQ" (#95) in A_UserGuide.txt file.

	
	0a. [XW_TraitPathChoiceWnd]

	TraitPathChoiceWnd.dxpack

	This dxpack allows users to see modded Champion Paths w/o having to scroll (Up to 10 Paths).

	You may only use one version at any time, but you can change that version as many time as you want.

	You current version should be the "5 Columns (Core)" version. This is also the backup file.

	\5 Columns (Core)\	Can see up to 5 Paths (Width: 1024)
	\6 Columns\ 		Can see up to 6 Paths (Width: 1217)
	\7 Columns\ 		Can see up to 7 Paths (Width: 1410)
	\8 Columns\ 		Can see up to 8 Paths (Width: 1603)
	\9 Columns\ 		Can see up to 9 Paths (Width: 1796)
	\10 Columns\ 		Can see up to 10 Paths (Width: 1989)

	NOTE: While there is no scroll bar, you can always scroll down/up with your mouse scroll to the 2nd (or 3rd) page to see more Paths.


	0b. [XW_TraitPathChoiceWnd_2_Rows]

	TraitPathChoiceWnd.dxpack
	TraitPathEntryWnd.dxpack

	As of 1.8.g., more options have been added (Two rows of Paths instead of one).

	These dxpack must be used together. They allows users to see modded Champion Paths on two rows w/o having to scroll (Up to 14 Paths).

	You may only use one version at any time, but you can change that version as many time as you want.

	You current version should be the "1024x768 (Core)" version. This is also the backup file.

	\1024x768 (Core)\
	\1366x768 (12 Paths)\
	\1550x950 (12 Paths)\
	\1750x950 (14 Paths)\

	NOTE:
	Be aware that TraitPathEntryWnd.dxpack used in "0a." is the Core one and, as such, is different than the one used in "0b."
	If you want to go back from 0b. to 0a., use the backup TraitPathEntryWnd.dxpack found in \1024x768 (Core)\
