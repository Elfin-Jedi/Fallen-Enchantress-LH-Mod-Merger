0. Preamble

	IMPORTANT:
	If your LH installation is in a custom directory instead of the default directory, you will have (resolvable) issues w/ DXPACK files.
	For more information, see "T2. (Others) - Troubleshooting, Known Issues, Knowledge Base, and FAQ" (#95) in A_UserGuide.txt file.

	
	MainGameWnd.dxpack
	MainActionsContextWnd.dxpack
	MainContextDetailsSubWnd.dxpack
	MainContextVitalsWnd.dxpack

	These dxpack must be used together. They modify the Strategic Main Screen, allowing, among others, for 10 hotkeys to be displayed.

	You may only use one version at any time, but you can change that version as many time as you want.

	You current version should be the "05 Hotkeys (Core)" version. This is also the backup file.

	\05 Hotkeys (Core)\
	\10 Hotkeys\



1. Installation
