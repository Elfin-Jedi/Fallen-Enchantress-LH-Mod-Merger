	IMPORTANT:
	If your LH installation is in a custom directory instead of the default directory, you will have (resolvable) issues w/ DXPACK files.

	These dxpack must be used together. They modify the Sovereign Creation Screen, allowing more information to be displayed.

	You may only use one version at any time, but you can change that version as many time as you want.

	You current version should be the "1024x768 (Core)" version. This is also the backup file.

	\1024x768 (Core)\
	\1280x1024\
