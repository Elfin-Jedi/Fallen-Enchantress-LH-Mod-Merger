0. Preamble

	Recommended (but not required) System Requirements: 4 GB of Memory and a 64-bit Operating System to play LH + XtraDeconstruct.

	DELETE (or move elsewhere) the content of the following folders:
		%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Race\
		%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Units\

	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	IF you want to play w/ Black Market Bazaar, Champion Bonanza, and/or Children of Storm, you NEED the ORIGINAL Mods as well as the Compatibility Files.
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
1. Installation (Part I: Extraction)

	Extract .7z file(s) in %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\

	If you Right-Click in the Contextual Menu and use "Extract Here" (if available), then the extraction process should create the appropriate folders

	Otherwise, your setup needs to look like this:

	...\Mods\0_NO\...
	...\Mods\Data\X_elemental.str
	...\Mods\Gfx\XtraDeconstruct\...
	...\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\...
	...\Mods\A_CoreAbilities.xml
	...\Mods\A_CoreSovereigns.xml

	See ( %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\ ):
	https://cdn.stardock.us/forums/55/5/5505675/3f446d62-54f3-41e0-844a-b194948da732.png

2. Installation (Part II: Copy+Paste)

	Locate the 0_NO folder:
	%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\0_NO\

	Copy all files found in said folder (Ctrl+A, followed by Ctrl+C)

	Locate the Core folder:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\data\English\
	or
	C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\data\English\

	Paste all previously copied files (Ctrl+V)

	If/When asked what to do, click "Copy and Replace"
	If/When asked if you still want to merge folders, click "Yes"



COMPATIBLE MODS
3. IF Champion Bonanza MOD is installed (along w/ XtraDeconstruct Compatibility File), but DLC02 (Quest Pack) or DLC04 (The Dead World) are not, you need to delete some files:

	IF missing DLC02 (Quest Pack), delete:
	XM_CB_Units_Champions_D2.xml.xml

	Located at:
	%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_ChampionBonanza\


	IF missing DLC04 (The Dead World), delete:
	XM_CB_Units_Champions_D4.xml

	Located at:
	%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_ChampionBonanza\


	NOTE: I strongly recommend using Champion Bonanza as there are not enough Champions in Vanilla LH



FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
4. I strongly recommend reading Sections "H10" (To fix the Unit Details Window), and "M1" (This is only needed once you've created Custom Factions)

	H10. (UI) - XW_UnitDetailsWnd

	M1. (Modding) - Custom Factions & Tech Tree



5. Proceed with Optional/Others/Modding steps if desired (See other sections, below, for more information)



6. Launch LH



7. Enable Mods:

	Options > Use Mods



8. Relaunch LH and start a NEW game

A2. (XtraDeconstruct) - Compatibility Files Installation [XD_DLC & XD_MOD]
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	Compatibility files require the specific DLC or the original MOD.

	Compatibility files require an XtraDeconstruct Main file.

	Depending on which XtraDeconstruct Main file you downloaded, these folders and files may have already been installed during the extraction.

	List of Optional files:

____________________________________________________________________

A3. (XtraDeconstruct) - Preloaded Mods
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	Preloaded Mods are fully integrated Mods and do not require any additional downloads.

	As they are standalone Mods, they can be removed without breaking the foundation of XtraDeconstruct.



1. To remove one or many Preloaded Mod(s), delete the following folder(s):

	Modified Level 6 and 7 Cities MOD:
	%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_AlphaCities\

____________________________________________________________________

E1. (Optional) - XO_NameGenerator
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	As with most supplementary sections (Optional, Others, Modding), you are not required to do the changes set out here to play XtraDeconstruct.


	You should NOT enable the Name Generator. If you really want to, read what follows:

	XO_NameGenerator.xml improves the Random Name Generator for Sovereign creation.


	Limitations:
	The Name Generator is used for Faction names, Sovereign names, and supernumerary City names.

	However, I haven't seen any particular way to attach rules for Factions or Cities.

	This means you won't be getting Faction and City names out of it with how I've currently designed it.


	IF this is a problem, then DO NOT disable WorldNameRuleset.xml . As XO_NameGenerator is superseded by it, this means the new Random Name Generator won't be used.

	EVEN IF this is not a problem, I would still recommend to use XO_NameGenerator for Sovereign Creation only. For gaming, you should always re-enable WorldNameRuleset.xml .



1. Installation (NameGenerator)

	The XO_NameGenerator does not supersede the Core LH Name Generator. In order to activate it, you need to:

	Locate the Core folder:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\data\English\
	or
	C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\data\English\

	Locate file:
	WorldNameRuleset.xml

	Rename to:
	WorldNameRuleset.NO



2. After creating your Sovereign, you should exit LH and undo what you did in '1. Installation (NameGenerator)'



____________________________________________________________________

G1. (Optional) - DirectDraw Surface (.dds) files
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	As with most supplementary sections (Optional, Others, Modding), you are not required to do the changes set out here to play XtraDeconstruct.


	You do NOT need to do anything as this is already setup. If, however, you want to modify the default configuration read what follows:

	This section applies to the \Mods\Gfx\XtraDeconstruct\X_DDS\ folder.

	TileSelectionTexture_Tactical is a file that highlights tiles where you can go during a fight.

	I've included three variations:
		TileSelectionTexture_Tactical_10.dds (+10% opacity)
		TileSelectionTexture_Tactical_15.dds (+15% opacity)
		TileSelectionTexture_Tactical_20.dds (+20% opacity)

	Note that the TileSelectionTexture_Tactical.dds found in the \DDS\ folder (The one used by LH) is the same as TileSelectionTexture_Tactical_15.dds .



1. Installation

	LH will use whichever file you rename TileSelectionTexture_Tactical.dds

	Thus, you only need to rename whichever variation you want (Remove the _10, _15, _20, but keep the .dds extension) to activate it


	If you would rather use the Core version (and ruin your eyes!), you can simply delete TileSelectionTexture_Tactical.dds from the \DDS\ folder

	You do not need to delete the _10, _15, or _20 variations as those versions are dormant and not used by LH



____________________________________________________________________

G2. (Optional) - DirectDraw Surface (.dds) River files
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	As with most supplementary sections (Optional, Others, Modding), you are not required to do the changes set out here to play XtraDeconstruct.


	This section applies to the \Mods\Gfx\XtraDeconstruct\X_DDS_Rivers\ folder.

	I really liked Rivers in 'Fallen Enchantress' (FE), not so much in 'Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes' (FELH).

	The two files found in that directory will restore FE Rivers.

	FE_RiverBed2.dds
	FE_RiverWaterDiffuse.dds



1. Installation

	The files are currently dormant

	LH will use these files if you remove the "FE_" prefix, such as they become:

	RiverBed2.dds
	RiverWaterDiffuse.dds

0. Preamble

	As with most supplementary sections (Optional, Others, Modding), you are not required to do the changes set out here to play XtraDeconstruct.

	IMPORTANT:
	If your LH installation is in a custom directory instead of the default directory, you will have (resolvable) issues w/ DXPACK files.
	For more information, see "T2. (Others) - Troubleshooting, Known Issues, Knowledge Base, and FAQ" (#95).


	This is my User Interface setup.

	If you have a 1920x1080 resolution (or greater), you can skip sections H2 to H10 and use the files found here instead.



1. Installation

	You need to move ALL the .dxpack files from the selected MOD Directory:
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\XW_1920x1080_Primal\

	To the Core Directory:

	For more information, see "T2. (Others) - Troubleshooting, Known Issues, Knowledge Base, and FAQ" (#95).


	TrophyEntryWnd.dxpack
	TrophyWnd.dxpack

	These dxpack must be used together. They make the Trophy Screen larger, which can fit a more detailed descriptions and a longer City list.

	You may only use one version at any time, but you can change that version as many time as you want.

	You current version should be the "1024x768 (Core)" version. This is also the backup file.

M1. (Modding) - Custom Factions & Tech Tree
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	+++ READ CAREFULLY +++

	Legendary Heroes automatically assigns the Core Amarian Tech Tree (TechTree_Amarian) to Custom Factions.

	That Tech Tree can't be fully modded from the \Mods\ folder so I've created new Tech Trees for all the Races.

	For CUSTOM Factions, you need to use one, so you will need to do some basic modding.

	Note that you will find a more or less up-to-date visual display of XtraDeconstruct Tech Tree online at:

M2. (Modding\Optional) - Custom Sovereigns & Cult Secret Scroll
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	As with most supplementary sections (Optional, Others, Modding), you are not required to do the changes set out here to play XtraDeconstruct.


	Consumables items (e.g. Scrolls) can't be made available in the Custom Sovereign > Appearance > Equipment Screen.
	
	If you want to use a specific Cult Secret Scroll for CUSTOM Sovereigns, you will need to do some basic modding. Let's get started!

	NOTE1:
	I've already added a Cult Secret Scroll to all Generic Sovereigns (Used to create Custom Sovereigns), but it might not be the one you want.

	NOTE2:
	If you end up w/ two Cult Secret Scrolls, you will have to pick the one you want to use (Can only use one) and sell the other one.


1. Find your custom Sovereign

	The filename should be your Custom Sovereign name followed by a random number, followed by .xml (e.g. Crazy_-123456-7890.xml)
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Units\



2. Edit the XML file w/ Notepad.



3. Find an occurrence of:

	</AutoCreateEquipment>



4. Add a new line directly under the tag you found in #3 (Only one Cult Secret Scroll should be used).

	<AutoCreateEquipment>Item_XL_SSP_A</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Cult Air-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Item_XL_SSP_D</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Cult Death-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Item_XL_SSP_E</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Cult Earth-->

	<AutoCreateEquipment>Item_XL_SSP_S</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Cult Shadow-->

	<AutoCreateEquipment>Item_XL_SSP_C</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Cult Chaos--><!--Disabled-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Item_XL_SSP_O</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Cult Order--><!--Disabled-->
	NOTE: Cult Secret Scroll Chaos and Cult Secret Scroll Order are currently disabled and will not appear in your Inventory.



____________________________________________________________________

M3. (Modding\Optional) - Custom Sovereigns & Path Scroll
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	As with most supplementary sections (Optional, Others, Modding), you are not required to do the changes set out here to play XtraDeconstruct.

	IMPORTANT:
	Path Scrolls are now disabled and the file extension must be changed to .xml before they can be used again (XE_InvitationScrolls.NO to .xml)
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\X_Equipment\XE_InvitationScrolls.NO


	You do NOT need this to play XtraDeconstruct. If you really want to use a Path Scroll, read what follows:

	Consumables items (e.g. Scrolls) can't be made available in the Custom Sovereign > Appearance > Equipment Screen.

	IF you want to use them for CUSTOM Sovereigns you will need to do some basic modding. Let's get started!

	NOTE1:
	Path Scrolls were first and foremost created so that all AI would select an appropriate Path for their Sovereign.

	You may still use them as a Player, but it's an AI feature.

	For more information, see "T2. (Others) - Troubleshooting, Known Issues, Knowledge Base, and FAQ" (#9).

	NOTE2:
	If you want to combine a Path Scroll and Dual Class, available as a Custom Sovereign Talent, you need to follow specific steps.
		1. Cast the Path Spell first (From Dual Class Talent);
		2. Use the Path Scroll second (Likely a few levels later) after having dispelled the Path Spell Enchantment.


1. Find your custom Sovereign

	The filename should be your Custom Sovereign name followed by a random number, followed by .xml (e.g. Crazy_-123456-7890.xml)
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Units\



2. Edit the XML file w/ Notepad.



3. Find an occurrence of:

	</AutoCreateEquipment>



4. Add a new line directly under the tag you found in #3 (Only one Path Scroll is needed, you will not be able to use more than one and they have no shop value):

	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_A</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Assassin-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_D</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Defender-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_G</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Commander (G=Governor)-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_M</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Mage-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_W</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Warrior-->

	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_Ba</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Bard-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_Ne</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Gravelord (Requires Necromancy Revamped Mod)-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_Pa</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Paladin (Requires Path of the Paladin Mod)-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_Ra</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Ranger-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_Sh</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Shaman-->
	<AutoCreateEquipment>Consumable_X_Path_So</AutoCreateEquipment><!--Sorcerer (Requires Path of the Sorcerer Mod)-->

M4. (Modding\Optional) - Hiding/Unhiding Additional Combat Stats [UnitDetailsWnd]
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	+++IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY, YOU SHOULD READ "H10. (UI) - XW_UnitDetailsWnd"+++


	Some of the New UnitDetailsWnd.dxpack (et al.) can fit up to 7 rows of stats (7 x 6 = 42 UnitStats).
	[For instructions on how to install it, see "H10. (UI) - XW_UnitDetailsWnd"]
	
	These stats can be in the Attributes category or in the Combat Stats category.

	In some cases you may want to hide/unhide Combat Stats, especially if you are using a smaller than 1380x1020 UnitDetailsWnd.dxpack

	If you want to do this, you will need to do some basic modding. Let's get started!



1. Find X_UnitStatsDetails.xml

	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\X_UnitStatsDetails.xml



2. Edit the XML file w/ Notepad.



3. Find a UnitStat that you would like to hide/unhide in your Details/Equipment Screen.



4. Find that UnitStat <Hidden> tag:

	<Hidden>1</Hidden>

	or

	<Hidden>0</Hidden>



5. Mod it to

	<Hidden>0</Hidden>

	to unhide or


	<Hidden>1</Hidden>

	to hide.

M5. (Modding\Optional) - Rehabilitating OLD Custom Factions & Sovereigns
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	As with most supplementary sections (Optional, Others, Modding), you are not required to do the changes set out here to play XtraDeconstruct.

	HOWEVER, your OLD NON-XtraDeconstruct Custom Factions and Custom Sovereigns won't be compatible UNLESS you do these changes.
	Meaning if you do not do these changes, you need to move your old Custom Factions/Sovereigns somewhere else so that the AI doesn't access them, e.g.:
		...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroesBackup\Race\
		...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroesBackup\Units\

	Because of changes I did to the XML, OLD NON-XtraDeconstruct Custom Factions won't be compatible w/ XtraDeconstruct.
	(But Old XtraDeconstruct Factions will be compatible; this is mostly for new users)

	Additionally, most large Mods (including Children of Storm and XtraDeconstruct) are using the UnitStats Background Mod.

	Meaning OLD Custom Sovereigns aren't compatible w/ large Mods such as the ones previously mentioned.
	(Again, Old XtraDeconstuct Sovereigns will be compatible; this is mostly for new users)

	Finally, I don't recommend trying to rehabilitate OLD NON-XtraDeconstruct Custom Trained Units; just move them out of the way or delete them.

	At any rate, IF you want to rehabilitate OLD Custom Factions & Sovereigns, you will need to do some basic modding. Let's get started!



SECTION A.
1. Find your custom Faction:

	The filename is "Faction_" followed by the name of your Faction, followed by .xml (e.g. Faction_Crazies.xml)
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Race\



2. Edit the XML file w/ Notepad.



PART I
3. Find:

	TechTree_Amarian



4. Mod it to use one of the new TechTree as explained in "M1. (Modding) - Custom Factions & Tech Tree".



PART II
5. Find an occurrence of

	</SelAbilityBonusOption>



6. Add a new line directly under the tag you found in #5:

	<SelAbilityBonusOption>Ability_X_Deorcnysse1000</SelAbilityBonusOption>



SECTION B.
PART I
1. Find your custom Sovereign

	The filename should be your Custom Sovereign name followed by a random number, followed by .xml (e.g. Crazy_-123456-7890.xml)
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Units\



2. Edit the .xml file w/ Notepad.



3. Find an occurrence of:

	</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>



4. Add new lines directly under the tag you found in #3:

	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Talent_X_Clock</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>
	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Talent_XM_BlackHole</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>
	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Talent_X_XtraDeconstruct</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>
	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Ability_X_Adamant</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>
	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Ability_X_IsChampion</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>
	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Ability_X_IsHumanoid</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>
	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Ability_X_IsKingdom</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>
	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Ability_X_IsMale</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>
	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Ability_X_IsSovereign</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>

	NOTE that you may need to switch IsMale for IsFemale and/or IsKingdom for IsEmpire, depending on the Sovereign, see below.

	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Ability_X_IsFemale</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>
	<SelectedAbilityBonusOption>Ability_X_IsEmpire</SelectedAbilityBonusOption>



PART II
5. There's a few more things that could improve compatibility, but this covers the most important stuff. If you want, also read:

	"M2. (Modding\Optional) - Custom Sovereigns & Cult Secret Scroll", and
	"M3. (Modding\Optional) - Custom Sovereigns & Path Scroll"

T1. (Others) - Crashes
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	As with most supplementary sections (Optional, Others, Modding), you are not required to do the changes set out here to play XtraDeconstruct.


	LH crashes a lot.

	LH w/ Mods crashes even more.

	At any rate, I won't pretend I can fix this, but...


1. Video Drivers, Video Card, and FPS

	Update your video drivers; given the choice, you should pick the most stable version rather than the latest.

	Also, you should limit your FPS to 30 w/ an external program (e.g. nVidia Inspector).


2. Steam Cloud

	Turn LH Steam Cloud *off* .

		a. Go to your Steam Library

		b. Find "Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes" (FE:LH)

		c. Right-click on FE:LH

		d. Click 'Properties'

		e. Click 'Updates' Tab

		f. Uncheck the Steam Cloud option

		NOTE: If said option is greyed out (Meaning you cannot check/uncheck it), it means your Steam Cloud is globally disabled, which is fine.


3. Settings

	There's a number of settings you can turn *off* to increase performance. Not all of what I mention next is about this, but this is how I play the game:

		Options > General > UNCHECK
			Auto Turn
			Quick Move
			Auto Select Next Unit
			Unit Movement Within Tile
			Tutorial Popups

			Auto Save*
			*If you uncheck Auto Save, make sure to manually Save often and take a small pause before you press (End) "Turn".
			*Auto Save is an important crash factor as it uses memory and CPU concurrently to when it is most needed (in-between Seasons).
			*Additionally, Auto Saved Games aren't as reliable as Normal Saved Games; in fact, they're so unreliable the feature should simply not exist.


		Options > Display > UNCHECK
			Character Outlines
			Pedestrians
			Dynamic Shadows

			Particle Effects*
			*Unchecking Particle Effects increases performance, but it makes some Creatures invisible (Particle Only Creatures, such as Wisps).

			Other Outlines*
			*Should probably be unchecked, but I like to use this.

			Show Grid*
			*I don't play w/ the Grid, but I'm guessing many players do and it probably doesn't have such a big impact on performance.


		Options > Audio > UNCHECK
			Music
			Event Music
			Ambient Sound

			*Definitely helps to uncheck these, but then again, user experience comes first and the Music is pretty good, so up to you.
			*Unfortunately, the SFX option should probably be unchecked as well for better stability.


		Options > Advanced Options > General > UNCHECK
			City Build Mode Zoom
			Follow Selected Unit*
			*While I keep Follow Selected Unit unchecked, I've been wondering if this isn't what is causing units to sometimes move over a tile without looting it.
				(However, I believe this issue is mostly, but not entirely, caused by checking 'Quick Move' Option)

			Zoom Limiting
			Snap Back When Rotating
			Smart Player Colors
			Scale Units When Zooming


		Options > Advanced Options > Display > UNCHECK (or SET)
			Cloth Map Only

			Cloth Map Zoom Level (I use 87) [SET]

			Stylized Lighting*
			*Unchecking Stylized Lighting increases performance, but may create graphic glitches (Dark zones).
			*Whenever you encounter a dark zone, simply open (and close) the Options Menu and the dark zone should disappear.

			Map Texture Atlas Size (I use 1024 x 4096)* [SET]
			*Some have reported that lowering this setting may fix Tactical Map lighting issues; but the Tooltip says to increase it to increase performance.
			*1024 x 4096 has turned out to be the one giving me the best performances, but that might be different for you.
			*1024 x 16384 was added by LH 2.0 update.

			Amount of Groundcover (None)* [SET]
			*While I keep Amount of Groundcover set to None, I've been wondering if this is creating issues with some Spells or Events creating "Groundcover".


4. Additional comments

	If crashes persist, you should Zoom Out completely (Clothmap) before clicking (End) Turn. Once the AI stops moving on the Clothmap, Zoom In to play.

	Also, make sure you close/disable all unnecessary programs, including your browser, your Antivirus, Steam Interface, as well as Windows Explorer.


5. Loading Game

	For some reasons, loading Saved Games when you're already in a game tends to produce graphic glitches and other issues, including crashes.

	If you tend to (re) load Saved Games (Which is why they exist... heh), exit and restart LH before loading your saved game.

	In other words, until Stardock patches the issue, starting LH allows you to load one Saved Game or start one New Game w/o having to restart LH.

	I suppose it's an unintentional Ironman Mode.


6. Preloaded Mods

	If you're still crashing too much after trying all of this, then it might be better to remove some preloaded Mods.

	It's up to you to decide which one to remove and when the game is stable enough...

	a. Level 6 and 7 Cities (a.k.a. AlphaCities) Mod, delete:
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_AlphaCities\

	b. Necromancy Revamped (a.k.a. Path of the Gravelord) Mod, delete:
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_NecromancyRevamped\
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\Gfx\XtraDeconstruct\X_M_NecromancyRevamped\

	c. Outpost Upgrades Mod, delete:
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_OutpostUpgrades\

	d. Path of the Paladin Mod, delete:
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_PathOfThePaladin\

	e. Path of the Sorcerer Mod, delete:
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_PathOfTheSorcerer\
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\Gfx\XtraDeconstruct\X_M_PathOfTheSorcerer\

	f. Republic Government Mod, delete:
	...\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_Republic\


7. The Nuclear Option (Cheat)

	There seem to be an issue w/ the Fog of War (FoW) and the AI, which might increase crashes. You can remove the FoW if you start LH in Cheat Mode:

		a. Steam Library > FELH > Properties > Create Desktop Shortcut

		b. Rename, e.g. LH (Cheat)

		c. Right click Shortcut > Properties > Web Document > URL:

		d. steam://rungameid/228260//Cheat

	Use that shortcut to start LH. In-game, use Ctrl+U to remove (or restore) the FoW.

	Also, having Cheat Mode available means you can use Ctrl+T instead of Auto-Resolve whenever the AI gets stuck in Tactical Mode.

	Finally, killing an enemy Sovereign w/ Ctrl+K will kill the Faction; it's also likely to reduce crashes as it will remove many units and cities.

	NOTE1: Steam Interface may be needed in the background to properly see the Cheat Dialog Box after you've double-click the shortcut.

	NOTE2: Don't forget to close the Steam Interface once the game has started, it seems to be a crash factor where FELH is concerned.


8. AppHangB1 Crashes

	You can get rid of many AppHangB1 crashes in Windows 7 if you 'Set Priority' for 'LegendaryHeroes.exe' to High in the Task Manager (Details).

	Because you don't want all your CPU set to High for LH, it's best to also 'Set Affinity' for 'LegendaryHeroes.exe' in the Task Manager (Details).

	For Set Affinity, check 50% of your CPU (Make sure to uncheck CPU 0), up to 4 CPU, and leave the rest unchecked.

	e.g.
	If you have a 4-core processor running two threads per core, you should see 8 CPU in Set Affinity.
	I believe FELH does not handle more than 4 CPU well at all and/or I believe FELH does not handle more than 1 thread per core well at all.
	So you should check/uncheck as follow (IF using 4-core processs with two threads per core):

	CPU 0 (UNCHECK)
	CPU 1 (CHECK)
	CPU 2 (CHECK)
	CPU 3 (CHECK)
	CPU 4 (CHECK)
	CPU 5 (UNCHECK)
	CPU 6 (UNCHECK)
	CPU 7 (UNCHECK)

	For additional information on how to do that, consult:
	http://forums.elementalgame.com/451107/page/76/#1879


9. BEX Crashes

	Some have reported that you can get rid of most BEX crashes in Windows 7. Not sure how reliable that information is.

	Right-click Computer and then select Properties. In properties, go to:

	Advanced system settings > Advanced > Performance > Settings > Data Execution Prevention

	And then select "Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select".

	Finally, find and add your 'LegendaryHeroes.exe' to the list of exceptions.
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\LegendaryHeroes.exe

0. I bought LH on GOG, can I use XtraDeconstruct?

	a. Yes, you may need to do some adjustments, but I generally list both the GOG and the Steam paths in this guide.


1. I hate this Mod and its nightmarishly long User Guide, it only brought me utter frustration and annoyance; I wanted to make sure you knew.

	a. Mods aren't supposed to fix your life; seek help, preferably professional help.

		a.1. But the Mod gave me a horrible experience!
			Read "U1. (Others) - Uninstalling".


2. A, B, or C is happening or not happening in my game, and after reading the Steam Forums, the Stardock Forums, and all of Google I can't find anything about it.

	a. If after reading this guide you still can't find your answer, just post in the XtraDeconstruct thread:
	http://forums.elementalgame.com/451107/page/87/#0

		a.1. You mean I didn't need to read all of Google?
			While I appreciate your commitment to the Renaissance Man ideals, no, you didn't need to read all of Google.

		a.2. Will my question make it into this section?
			Maybe.


3. I have a question about a preloaded Mod or a compatible Mod, can I ask it to you?

	a. Yes (and no). I will answer, but whether it's a preloaded Mod or a compatible Mod, they still aren't my Mods. Thus, I feel it's better if you actually ask your question to the original Modder:

	b. No (and yes). I will answer, but modders put a lot of time creating their Mods and they sure appreciate to discuss them w/ users.

		b.1. Yes/No, No/Yes, you confuse me.
			The more modders are modding, the more diversified the user experience will be.
			It's up to you to make this happen by interacting w/ modders, exchanging ideas, and acknowledging that they did something great.


4. When I try to start LH, it crashes.

	a. It's not unsual for LH to crash when you add one or more new mods (or new versions). Try starting it a second time.

		a.1. No, really, LH keeps crashing when I start it.

	b. Did you modify some XtraDeconstruct files?
		
		b.1. YES.
			XML syntax is rather strict in some cases. That is, if you forget a tag, somewhere, it could crash the game.
			
			b.1.1. Ok, but that doesn't really help.
				Download and install "Notepad++".
				Download and install the "XML Tools" plugin for Notepad++.
				In "Notepad++", go to "Plugins", then "XML Tools" and use "Check XML syntax now" for the files you've modified.

		b.2. NO / I'm still getting crashes when I try to start LH.
			I verify the XML syntax of my files before every release (and I play the game). It doesn't crash when trying to start the game.
		
			b.2.1. That wasn't helpful, like, at all.
				What I'm saying is XtraDeconstruct doesn't prevent the game from starting.
				If, however, you are using a different combination of mods then the one I'm using, who knows.

			b.2.2. Hum, o.k.
				Any mod that has a compatibility file should be fine.
				Any mod I list as being compatible, but w/o compatibility files will probably be fine.
				After that, you will be experimenting on your own...

	c. There are multiple reasons why LH might crash when you try to start it, check either Stardock Knowledgebase or LH Support Forums.

		c.1. Web addresses?
			Knowledgebase:

			NOTE: Customer service does not help w/ Mods.


5. The game hangs / crashes when I try to start a (New) Game (after having started LH).

	a. IF you've disabled WorldNameRuleset.xml (.NO), you need to make sure LH will read the new Random Name Generator file.

		a.1. How do I do that?
			Make sure mods are enabled (Restart LH if you make changes)
				> Options > Use Mods

			Make sure the main XML files are NOT in the data folder
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\Data\

			Make sure the files are NOT in the Fallen Enchantress Mods folder
				...\Documents\My Games\FallenEnchantress\Mods\

			Make sure the files ARE in the Legendary Heroes Mods folder (XtraDeconstruct)
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\

			Still hanging? Make sure the files are in the right folder


6. A River right next to my city has dissipated/disappeared.

	a. Cult Secret Scrolls, which allow you to cast "[S] A/D/E/F/L/W Shard" Spells, can also end up destroying a river if the spell spawns a Shard on a River Tile.

		a.1. That's annoying.
			You don't have to cast the Shard Spell right away, you can cast it on your second City.
			You can also cast the Shard Spell on any part of your City, not necessarily the City center.
			In other words, if you have a River (or a special Resource) two tiles right of your City center, don't cast the Spell on the City center.
			Cast it on some other parts to avoid destroying the River (or the special Resource).

		a.2. I didn't do it!
			AI can and will use Cult Secret Scrolls and Spells.
			If the AI spawns a Shard on a segment of river upstream or downstream of the river next to your city, then the river will be destroyed.
			Collateral Damage. Unlucky Day. Ctrl+N if needed (This usually happens within the first year of a new game).
			Because of LH 2.0 disappearing borders issue, Ctrl+N might not be the best advice anymore, but I think you get the idea...


7. I cast "[S] A/D/E/F/L/W Shard" Spell and I lost the game by Conquest.

	a. See the "[S] A/D/E/F/L/W Shard" Spell Warning (Tooltip)
		WARNING:
		Assuming the target position is (0,0).
		Then, the shard will pop up in position (2,0).
		Everything in position (2,0) will be destroyed.

		In other words, (0,0) is the (Capital) City position and (2,0) is the Shard position
			(Should be 2 tiles right of your City, but that depends on Camera angle).
		If your Sovereign is in (2,0), you will die. Permanently. And lose the game by Conquest.

	b. Why isn't the Spell setup as a Terraforming Spell?
		The AI doesn't use Terraforming Spells.

	c. Why isn't the Scroll spawning the Shard?
		Doing so confuses the AI.


8. I didn't cast "[S] A/D/E/F/L/W Shard" Spell and still lost the game by Conquest.

	a. Happens.

		a.1. LOL! I still had cities...
			In XtraDeconstruct, the AI can cast "[S] Curgen's Volcano (City)".
			If this Spell kills your Sovereign, you will lose the game by Conquest.

		a.2. Isn't that too powerful?
			You can cast the original version "[S] Curgen's Volcano" which does the same thing except anywhere on the map, including on cities.

		a.3. Still...
			(SPOILER)
			The AI version can only be cast on Cities.
			More often then not, the AI will target whichever City your Sovereign is resting in.
			Whenever the AI starts casting the Spell, the sky/view will dim/darken for a few seconds and the camera will shake for a bit.
			This is sign of bad things to come: move your Sovereign/Champions OUT of your Cities and into the open until a Volcano appears.
			Cast Time for "[S] Curgen's Volcano (City)" is 2, meaning the Volcano will appear 2 Seasons after you see the dim/darken sky/view.
			The Area destroyed by the Volcano is 5x5, centered on the targeted City.


9. When I use a Path Scroll (e.g. The Guild, The Castle, The Embassy, The Tower, The Barrack, etc.), my Sovereign or Champion accesses all the Paths.

	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	As of 2.0.n., Path Scrolls have been disabled.
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	a. That's normal. As described on the Path Scroll, you will get 1 Permanent Path and multiple 1-Season Paths; the 1-Season Paths will disappear when you click (End) "Turn".

		a.1. What's the point?
			The Path Scrolls were first and foremost created so that all AI would select an appropriate Path for their Sovereign.
			While I could have simply put the Path ability right into the code, this would have prevented players from selecting their own Sovereign Paths.
			However, Players and AI were able to use the Path Scrolls to Dual Class rather than simply select one Path.
			Designing the Path Scroll as they are now blocks this sort of abuse.

		a.2. Dual Class? That's awesome! Why would you block that feature?
			Because that wasn't the purpose of the Path Scrolls.
			Because Dual Class, as unlocked by the Path Scroll, wasn't working properly.
			In other words, it was an exploit and a broken one at that.

		a.3. Still, Dual Class would have been awesome...
			XtraDeconstruct lets you select Dual Class as a Talent for your Sovereign if you create a Custom Sovereign.

		a.4. O.k., but that Path Scroll still forces me to select a General Ability for my first Ability, therefore losing the chance to select a Path Ability.
			Had you not use the Path Scroll, you would have had to select a Path on Level 2.
			Therefore, you are actually gaining an extra General Ability on Level 2 instead of selecting a Path (and a free level to boot).

		a.5. O.k., that's great, but I'm still curious why you are unlocking Paths that aren't even in your Mod?
			Because I enjoy creating compatibility with as many mods as I can (Given there is a purpose to it).
			However, it takes two to tango.
			NOTE1: The paths that weren't in my Mod weren't really unlocked, it was cosmetic compatibility fix.
			NOTE2: Deprecated.

		a.6. I'm still not convinced I like this feature.
			Sell the scroll or don't use it.

		a.7. I don't want the AI to use them either.
			Delete XE_InvitationScrolls.xml
			...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\X_Equipment\XE_InvitationScrolls.xml

		a.8. I want to re-enable Path Scrolls.
			You need to rename the following files (Modify the extension from .NO/.xml to .xml/.NO):
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\X_Equipment\XE_InvitationScrolls.NO
			to:
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\X_Equipment\XE_InvitationScrolls.xml


10. The Champion Equipment Ability does not show up in every Recruitment Choice Window, why?

	a. The original Window only allow for 8 non-Spellbook Abilities to be displayed. Sometimes the Equipment Ability is 9+.

		a.1. Fix it!
			I already did, go to "H5. (UI\Optional) - XW_dxpack" and install the RecruitChoiceWnd.dxpack

		a.2. Why is this topic still here then?
			Not everyone has at least a 1280 x 960 resolution, hence the need for this topic.

		a.3. My resolution is less than 1280 x 960.
			Should generally be fine as the Equipment Ability is now in the first spot or visible for all(?) Champions.
			If you report which Champions are missing the Equipment Ability, I will fix them in the next version.

		a.4. Does that mean the Recruitment Choice Window might also be missing other non-Spellbook Abilities?
			If you're not using the 1280x960 RecruitChoiceWnd.dxpack which is larger and has two rows of non-Spellbook Abilities, yes.

		a.5. My LH game is installed in a custom directory.
			See FAQ #95.


11. There is something wrong with the Descriptions and/or Provides.

	a. Nope.

		a.1. Haaaaaaah...
			I'm more than willing to improve them if you find typos, missing elements, broken formulas, etc.
			However, XtraDeconstruct format is there to stay (Including #Hashtags); if you don't like it, I can't help you.

		a.2. I absolutely hate the hashtags, the fact you don't see those as irritating is just beyond me (Insert profanities).
			See a.1., above.
			It's beyond me that you would take the time to post about it, argue about it, or whatnot, as it's not going to change.
			While I value constructive criticism, suggestions, and bug reports, posting how you hate this (or anything else for that matter) will only make you look like an immature entitled jerk.

			a.2.1. I really don't give a damn.
				Me neither, let's agree to disagree.

		a.3. It breaks my immersion.
			If immersion is your #1 criterion, then this is not the Mod for you.
			That's not to say I don't make efforts to make the Mod immersive.
			However, quality of information ranks above immersion in my criteria and the display of information reflects that.


12. There is something wrong with the Unit Equipment Window, the Stats are spilling over the Equipment / Inventory.

	a. Read "H10. (UI) - XW_UnitDetailsWnd"

		a.1. That doesn't work, my screen resolution is too small!
			Read "M4. (Modding\Optional) - Hiding/Unhiding Additional Combat Stats [UnitDetailsWnd]"

		a.2. Anything else I could do instead?
			Delete X_UnitStatsDetails.xml
			...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\X_UnitStatsDetails.xml

		a.3. What will that do?
			Send you back to the Stone Age.

		a.4. Really?
			No, that will actually remove the new UnitStats icons and the new UnitStats nomenclature.
			That will also hide many of them.

		a.5. Why are you so snarky?
			I'm not snarky, I'm sunny!

		a.6. My LH game is installed in a custom directory.
			See FAQ #95.


13. Treasure Hunter doesn't seem to work.

	a. Treasure Hunter gives a 5% chance of getting better loot. On average, that's 1 loot upgrade per 20 lairs, which means you won't see this very often.

		a.1. I know that...

	b. It also seems to be hardcoded to upgrade Common to Uncommon and Uncommon to Rare.

		b.1. Why are you telling me this?
			In XtraDeconstruct, there's Un/Common, Un/Common1, Un/Common2, Un/Common3, Un/Common4, and their Rare equivalents.
			Meaning Un/Common1 to Un/Common4 aren't upgrading if Treasure Hunter is hardcoded to Common/Uncommon/Rare.

		b.2. Wait, are you telling me the 5% is actually 1% because you've quintupled the loot categories?
			That's what I think, yes.

		b.3. And this applies to Common --> Uncommon and Uncommon --> Rare?
			Yes.

		b.4. What about Rare to (something) and/or Reliquary?
			Treasure Hunter doesn't apply to these loot categories.

		b.5. Ugh, anything you can do?
			I've quintupled Treasure Hunter value (5% * 5 = 25%), which should compensate for having quintupled loot categories (25% / 5 = 5%)

		b.6. Any caveats?
			Treasure Hunter still only applies to Un/Common, not Un/Common1-4.
			20% is the new 100%, anything over that value is useless.

	c. Would you want to know why I've quintupled loot categories?

		c.1. Are you reading my mind?
			I'd rather not answer that.

		c.2. You were saying...
			Right, loot categories.
			Whenever you start a game, 54 items per random loot category are selected; everything else is discarded.

		c.3. So quintupling loot categories increases the pool of items and, in the end, improves randomness?
			Are you reading my mind?


14. I left one of my Champion in a City and he/she/it disappeared.

	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	As of 2.0.g., Champion Camps have been disabled.
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	a. Champions recruited through Champion Camps on the Strategic Map must NOT be in the Camp when you recruit them (They must be on the Tile adjacent to the Camp).

		a.1. What?
			Champion Camps are a Fallen Enchantress relic that I've reactivated in Legendary Heroes (with considerable effort I might add).
			Because they are not normally available in Legendary Heroes, they are not supported by Stardock.

		a.2. So?
			Basically, if a Champion is found inside a Champion Camp (Specifically, *ON* the Camp Tile), it will suffer from the dreaded Tamed Beast Bug.

		a.3. What is the Tamed Beast Bug?
			It's a bug that was introduced by LH 1.5 (Specifically, it was introduced by the Wildland Fix).
			At the time, any Tamed Lair Guardian (Not necessarily Beasts, although they constituted the brunt of Tamed Creatures) would disappear if left in a City.
			While the issue was subsequently corrected by LH 1.6, it doesn't look like it will ever be fixed for Champion Camps.

		a.4. How are Champions standing on a Camp Tile affected?
			They will disappear if stationed in Cities.
			They will be unable to cast specific Champion Spells even if they are in your Spellbook.
			They won't appear as an Army on the (left) side of the screen.
			If they die, it's forever (They won't go to the nearest City).
			Meaning you may as well not recruit said Champions, unless you want to Steal their Spirit and/or sell/use their Equipment.

		a.5. Why don't you fix it?
			I can't fix the issue directly, only Stardock can.
			However, using WanderingRadius = 1 instead of 0 fixes the issue from an XML point of view for most Camps (In a perfect world, 88.8%).
			Just remember: to avoid the issue, recruited Champions MUST be outside of their Camp when you recruit them.

		a.6. Despite your claims, Champions are spawning on the Camp Tile 100% of the time, what's up with that?
			Do a clean install of XtraDeconstruct:
				i- Backup your \Race\, \Saves\, \Screenshots\, and \Units\ (If you want to keep them);
				ii- Then delete everything in your ...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\ folder
				iii- Then install XtraDeconstruct following instructions set out in "A1. (XtraDeconstruct) - Full Download Installation Instructions"

		a.7. I want to re-enable Champion Camps.
			You need to rename the following files (Modify the extension from .NO/.xml to .xml/.NO):
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\X_Abilities\XA_ChampionCamps.NO
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\X_GoodieHuts\XG_Lairs_Champions.NO

15. I just recruited a new Champion. He/She/It is supposed to be able to cast Spell A, Spell B, and/or Spell C, but he/she can't.

	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	As of 2.0.g., Champion Camps have been disabled.
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	a. If you recruited the Champion from a Champion Camp, see #14.


16. I just recruited a new Champion. He/She/It doesn't appear in my Champion List on the left side of the screen.

	a. If you recruited the Champion from a Champion Camp, see #14.


17. I just recruited a new Champion. He/She/It doesn't respawn in my cities when killed.

	a. If you recruited the Champion from a Champion Camp, see #14.


18. At 3 Fame, at 50 Fame, or at X Fame, no Fame Event happened. In other words, I didn't get to recruit additional Champions.

	a. LH only comes w/ 100 or so Champions, you are probably running out of Champions.

		a.1. Why is life so complicated?
			In this case, Champion Bonanza Mod makes life uncomplicated.

19. At 3 Fame, at 50 Fame, or at X Fame, I crashed.

	a. LH only comes w/ 100 or so Champions, you are probably running out of Champions.

		a.1. Hey! That's the same answer as the previous question...
			Your power of observation continue to serve you well.
			If you're playing on anything bigger than Medium (Large, Huge, Colossal, Gargantuan, Titanic, Ludicrous), you will run out of Champions.
			If you're playing against a gazillion AI, you will run out of Champions.
			For some players, this will crash their game, for others (Like me), they will do just fine except they won't get Champions.

		a.2. Why are you offering those map choices then?
			The problem is choice.

		a.3. I'm never using your Mod again!
			There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.

		a.4. What the...
			Running out of Champions is still a problem if you play Vanilla LH; it's just being exacerbated by XtraDeconstruct.
			If you use Champion Bonanza along with XtraDeconstruct, the problem will disappear.

20. What are the "Go Home" Spells?

	a. Go Home (1/2) and (2/2) are a 2-part 1-time teleport to your Capital for every single Champion you get.

		a.1. Why?
			Champions you get from Champion Fame Events are spawned in the middle of nowhere.
			Sometimes your party is full, sometimes you don't have additional equipment to give to that Champion, sometimes...
			In other words, Champions should probably spawn near or in your Capital, but they don't.

		a.2. Why not make a simple Teleport Spell instead of setting it up like this?
			It's set up like this to prevent abuse: only said Champion should be able to go back to your Capital.
			In other words, it's not so much a teleport Spell, but a fix that "spawns" the Champion in your Capital.

		a.3. O.k., but even if it's set up like that, I've found ways to use that Spell for other means (I can abuse it!!!).
			It's a single player game w/ no online rankings or Hall of Fame; did it feel good at least?


21. What are the "Tireless Page" and the "Flying Page" Spells?

	a. They're a Courier feature that allows you to trade equipment between your Champions/Sovereign even if they are pretty far apart from each other.

		a.1. Oooh, nice! Would be much easier if you had a detailed manual of everything.
			I agree with the general sentiment that detailed manuals (of everything) are great.
			It's unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future for XtraDeconstruct for various reasons.

		a.2. ...
			I believe part of what makes a great 4X Strategy game is discovering what something (everything) does.
			And then learning how to use it properly and efficiently toward victory.
			Plus various other reasons.

		a.3. ...
			If some users are willing to write one, I could integrate the information in A_UserGuide.txt or as a .txt file; contact me.

		a.4. ...
			Still there? To tell you the truth, most people don't read manuals. Crazy right?


22. I tried to play with 28, 29, 30, or more AI and it crashed during map generation.

	a. AFAIK, 27 AI is the maximum, LH will crash if you try with 28 or more AI; whether or not this value is the same for everyone remains to be seen.


23. I selected Master Quest in Victory Conditions, but the Master Quest Wildland didn't spawn, what's happening?

	a. Master Quest Wildland is disabled because I find it imbalanced (Curgen's Hammer), unfair (The AI can't do it), and annoying (It ALWAYS spawns).

		a.1. Can I re-enable it?
			Yes, just delete XL_NoMasterQuest.xml found in:
			...\X_Wildlands\XL_NoMasterQuest.xml


24. I selected XSavage1 (or any other XSavage#) for World Difficulty, but the Creatures aren't harder than usual; in fact I think they are weaker.

	a. XSavage1 to XSavage10 should NOT be selected for World Difficulty, they are created for Typical Intelligence of Opponents.

		a.1. Well, they are showing in both categories and it's confusing.
			Indeed, but if you hover over XSavage difficulties in World Difficulty, it will say "DO NOT PICK XSAVAGE#..."
			I was hoping this would be a sufficient indicator not to pick them.

		a.2. Why not just remove them entirely from World Difficulty?
			I can't, as soon as a new difficulty setting is created it shows up in both 'World Difficulty' and 'Typical Intelligence of Opponents'.

		a.3. O.k., but what about my current game, what is the World Difficulty if it's not XSavage#?
			The Creatures bonuses/penalties are hardcoded, so I can't add, remove, or modify them.
			In other words, if you selected an XSavage# World Difficulty setting, it will be equal to Normal [1.00].


25. I selected XSavage4 (or XSavage5), but I think they aren't as hard as Insane, are you sure the number you've assigned between brackets are right?

	a. For XSavage difficulty settings, the number in-between brackets are the same as the number used for:
		AIEconomicRatio
		AIHPRatio
		AIStartingFundsRatio (x10)
		AISovereignHPRatio

	    For Vanilla LH difficulty settings, the number in-between brackets are the same as the number used for:
		AIEconomicRatio

		a.1. So?
			As one can guess, that means, relatively speaking, that XSavage1 is weaker than XSavage2, which is weaker than XSavage3, ...
			It also means the number is relevant if you're trying to understand the increase in difficulty between XSavage1 to, say, XSavage4.
			However, it's more difficulty to determine whether Insane is easier or more difficulty than XSavage4 or XSavage5.
			However (bis), XSavage6 is most certainly more difficult than Insane.

		a.2. What makes Insane possibly harder/weaker than XSavage4 or XSavage5?
						Insane	XS4	XS5
			Economic Ratio		2.00x	2.25x	2.50x
			Sovereign HP		3.00x 	2.25x	2.50x
			TrainedUnits HP		1.50x	2.25x	2.50x
			Starting Gildar		1000x	22.5x	25.0x

		a.3. Well, there's certainly a case to be made Insane could be harder than XSavage4 and XSavage5, wouldn't you say?
			It's debatable.
			It's irrelevant.
			XSavage1-2-3 were created to bridge the huge difference between Ridiculous-Insane.
			XSavage4-10 were created for continuity and increased difficulty, while not facing multiple AI w/ an absurd amount of Gildar.
			In that regard, they accomplish exactly what they were supposed to do.
			If you want to play against AI w/ 50K+ Gildar, then use Insane, otherwise stick w/ XSavage#.


26. I can't find the new Unit Templates (Werewolves / Vampires / Storm Elementals / Ophidians / Klay Golems / Brood Riders / Balrogs).

	a. Are you playing:
		[Werewolves] Undead (Children of Storm)
		[Vampires] The Dead (DLC04)
		[Storm Elementals] Faith Air
		[Ophidians] Pariden or New Pariden (DLC05)
		[Klay Golems] Faith Earth
		[Brood Riders] Resoln or New Resoln (DLC05) or Neikvaed (Necromancy Revamped)
		[Balrogs] Faith Fire

		a.1. Yes.
			Then Research Werewolves in the Magic Tech Tree.
			Then Research Vampires in the Magic Tech Tree.
			Then Research Storm Elementals in the Magic Tech Tree.
			Then Research Ophidian Legions in the Magic Tech Tree.
			Then Research Klay Golems in the Magic Tech Tree.
			Then Research Brood Riders in the Magic Tech Tree.
			Then Research Balrogs in the Magic Tech Tree.

		a.2. No, but I'm playing a Custom Faction based on said Races.
			Did you mod the Tech Tree?

			a.2.1. What?
				See "M1. (Modding) - Custom Factions & Tech Tree".

			a.2.2. After doing what's mentioned in a.2.1. and using a Wraith-based Custom Faction, I'm still not seeing the Brood Riders Tech.
				For Brood Riders, you also need a specific Faction Strength: Binding OR Reanimation Ritual.
				You also need Leader Pack DLC (DLC05), even if you're playing Resoln or Neikvaed.


27. I can't find Unit Templates for some of the new Faction Strengths (Henchmen / Iron Golems / Juggernauts).

	a. There aren't any, but you can edit the available standard units in-game to create new ones.


28. Some of the new techs seem to have extraordinarily low research costs compared to others from the same tier, is this intentional?

	a. Yes, there's a 5% increase in Tech Cost per Tech Researched and with the many Techs added, it makes getting everything much longer.


29. I saw two (stack of) creatures fighting, what's up with that?

	a. There is a Wild Faction (Monsters and Ruffians) and then there's a Wildland Faction (Denizen of the Wildlands); they don't like each other.

		a.1. Did you do that?
			No, it's always been like that.

		a.2. Who's going to win?
			Wild Faction is stronger than Wildland Faction, especially at higher World Difficulty settings.
			Given enough time, the Wild Faction would annihilate the Wildland Faction except for the Elemental Lords.

			a.2.1. If Wild Faction can't kill the Elemental Lords, doesn't that make Wildland Faction stronger?
			Rekt'd, roasted, and served?


30. I researched Battalion, Brigade, and Division, but I can't find how to train units using these Grouping Types.

	a. The .dxpack Screen only allows for 4 Grouping Types to be shown (Party, Group, Squad, and Company).

		a.1. Right, but...
			I wasn't finished!
			You can access the additional Grouping Types if you use the Upgrade feature, which costs 50 Gildar per Head.
			Thus, upgrading from 6 (Company) to 9 (Division) costs 150 Gildar.

		a.2. Ugh, I have to disburse Gildar if I want a Battalion, Brigade, or Division?
			50 Gildar per head is less resources than training that same unit member with full gear (Crystal, Metal, Mounts, etc.)

		a.3. That sounds like an exploit.
			Might look like one, but since the AI is comfortable using it (and is using it), it really is part of the game mechanics.

		a.4. What about Children of Storm Frost Giants?
			As of XtraDeconstruct 2.0.b., they can upgrade to 7 (Battalion), 8 (Brigade), and 9 (Division) using new Frost Giant Cloaks:
				Luminary Cloak is the equivalent of Battalion
				Forefather Cloak is the equivalent of Brigade
				Glacier Shepherd Cloak is the equivalent of Division
			Be aware that this makes Frost Giants -extremely- powerful, so much that I may have to rebalance the 9 cloaks.
				(I ended up rebalancing the cloaks)


31. The enemy Sovereigns I'm facing are leading Cthulhu illiterate Factions w/ the right Faction Traits but weird names (e.g. "Ibluutreh" instead of Tarth), what's up with that?

	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	Deprecated as of 2.0.k. (Fixed)
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	a. The Name Generator is to blame for the Cthulhu-like names (although Lovecraft had a chthonic inspiration, not so w/ the Core Name Generator).

		a.1. O.k., but my question encompassed more than that.

	b. Creating Custom Sovereigns with existing Races is to blame.

		b.1. What!? You're going to blame it on me?
			When you get to the "Who Opposes You?" Screen, select "Customize Opponents".
			In the list presented to you, you should be able to find which (Custom) Factions are using Core color schemes and names.
			In the list presented to you, you should be able to find which (Custom) Factions are using Random color schemes and names.

		b.2. No way!
			Yes way! Fortunately for you, that's not all.

	c. The Load Order is to blame for factions not having the names they are supposed to have.

		c.1. Yes! Anything I can do?
			You can move A_CoreSovereigns.xml outside of the Mods folder and into the Units folder.

		c.2. Come again?
			The load order is as follows:
				1. Program Files folders
				2. My Documents folders except Mods folders
				3. Mods folders (Alphabetical)
			Custom Sovereigns are found in 2.
			Mods folder Sovereigns are found in 3.
			Thus, Custom Sovereigns are stealing Mods folder Sovereigns mojo.

		c.3. O.k., so what can I do? Step by step, please.
			Locate A_CoreSovereigns.xml:
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\A_CoreSovereigns.xml
			Move it to the Units folder:
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Units\A_CoreSovereigns.xml

			ALTERNATIVELY, you could move the content of:
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Units\
			To XtraDeconstruct XZ_ZX folder:
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\XZ_ZX\

			If you use the second option, you will need to do that every time you create new/custom Sovereigns.

		c.4. That was easy, but I still want to blame you for this.

	d. Since I made you disable CoreUnits.xml found in the Program Files folders, which is the reason this is happening to Core Sovereigns, I'm to blame.

		d.1. My life is complete.


32. I set everything at Ludicrous, but there aren't that many Resources available, why?

	a. The Resources are spawned last and have to navigate through all sorts of limitations, notably ObjectsPerLandTile and DistanceBetweenObjects, which may prevent them from spawning properly.

		a.1. What can I do?
			Use no more than 2 Ludicrous settings, 1 Legendary, and 1 Dense, or any lesser combination, e.g.:
				Legendary Quest Frequency
				Ludicrous Monster Frequency
				Dense Magic Strength
				Ludicrous Resource Frequency

		a.2. Are those your settings?
			No, mine are usually:
				Legendary Quest Frequency
				Ludicrous Monster Frequency
				Sparse Magic Strength
				Moderate Resource Frequency


33. The Map Editor (Cartographer's Table) keeps crashing.

	a. Having more than 39 "RaceConfig InternalName" in the \Mods\ folder crashes the Map Editor.

		a.1. I really want to create maps, what can I do?
			You can disable some RaceConfig files while using the Map Editor and then re-enable them to play LH.

		a.2. How?
			If Children of Storm is installed along w/ XtraDeconstruct, you need to disable two files:

			Go to ...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\1\
			Find X1_Factions.xml
			Modify the file extension from .xml to .NO

			Go to ...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\M_ChildrenOfStorm\
			Find XM_CoS_Factions.xml
			Modify the file extension from .xml to .NO

			If Children of Storm isn't installed, you only need to disable X1_Factions.xml, as described above.

		a.3. Is that all?
			When you're done w/ the Map Editor, you need to exit LH, re-enable the files by modifying their extension (.xml), and restart LH.


34. Consumables don't always disappear after being used, in which case I can then use them any number of times...

	a. The safest place to use a consumable is from the Equipment Screen, which generally prevents this from happening.

		a.1. What's wrong with using them from the Loot Screen pop up or using them from "Hotkeys" on the Main Stategic Map Screen?
			I don't have an answer to that, other than to say it's safer to use them from the Equipment Screen if you want to avoid the issue.
			However, the issue seems to be linked to using said consumable a second time (if you happen to have two of said consumable).
			Also, the issue seems to be linked to a certain type of consumable.

		a.2. Which?
			Strategic UseSpell Consumables seem to be particularly vulnerable to this.
			It may, in fact, be the only type affected by this issue.

		a.3. That's all gibberish to me, do you have a list of such items?
			This may or may not be a complete list, but the following consumables are affected (BMB, CoS, Vanilla LH, and XtraDeconstruct):
				Ambrosia
				Arcane Monolith Scroll
				Blight Scroll
				Greater XP Scroll
				Horn Resounding
				Incombustible Torch
				Legendary XP Scroll
				Lesser XP Scroll
				Lost Barrowhill Wine
				Mortar and Pestle
				Recall Scroll
				Rejuvenating Fusion
				Return Scroll
				Regular XP Scroll
				Soul Contract
				Supreme XP Scroll
				Ultimate XP Scroll

		a.4. So if I use these Consumables from the Equipment Screen, I will be fine?
			Yes.


35. The AI doesn't seem to be using all Consumables.

	a. Indeed, the AI doesn't use some categories of Consumables.

		a.1. Which?
			Not entirely sure, but it doesn't use at least two categories:
				Cure Injuries Consumables
				Strategic UseSpell Consumables (See 34., above)

			I think there might be a third category, but I haven't tried to figure it out yet.


36. Thinking Machine Tech appeared in my Warfare Tech Tree, what's happening?

	a. I believe this has something to do w/ the AppearanceChance value of OTHER random Techs and the Random Number Generator value being picked.

		a.1. What should I do if that Tech appears in my Warfare Tech Tree?
			Don't research it.
			In fact, might as well Ctrl+N (Restart) if you find out about this at the beginning of your game...

			Also, I would appreciate if you report this issue, as I'm not sure if it's still hapening or not (haven't seen it in a while, fixed?).


37. Can I use my old Custom Factions and Custom Sovereigns?

	a. Not compatible, so no, you shouldn't be using them and, most importantly, you should move them somewhere else so that the AI doesn't access them.

		a.1. Move them somewhere else?
			Yes, outside of the LH folder so that the AI doesn't access them. Meaning OLD Custom files found in:
			...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Race\
			...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Units\

			should be moved to the following folders (or elsewhere not accessible):
			...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroesBackup\Race\
			...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroesBackup\Units\

		a.2. Can I make them compatible?
			You could, I'll look into it, but no ETA.

		a.3. I'm still waiting!
			See "M5. (Modding\Optional) - Rehabilitating OLD Custom Factions & Sovereigns".


38. Children of Storm (CoS) isn't compatible w/ DLC05 (Leader Pack), but XtraDeconstruct is; can I use CoS, XtraDeconstruct, and DLC05 at the same time?

	a. Yes and there's nothing special you need to do other than follow installation instructions; the compatibility is handled by XtraDeconstruct.


39. Children of Storm (CoS) hasn't been updated for LH 2.0 or LH 2.1; can I use Children of Storm?

	a. Yes and there's nothing special you need to do other than follow installation instructions; the compatibility is handled by XtraDeconstruct.


40. I don't see any compatibility files for DLC01 (Map Pack), is it compatible?

	a. Yes, no compatibility files are needed.


41. What is the difference between "Preloaded Mod" and "Compatible Mod"?

	a. Preloaded Mods are fully integrated and do not require any additional downloads.
		Alpha Cities (a.k.a. Level 6 and 7 Cities Mod)
		Necromancy Revamped (a.k.a. Path of the Gravelord)
		Outpost Ugrades
		Path of the Paladin
		Path of the Sorcerer
		Republic Government

	b. Compatible Mods are NOT fully integrated, I've only created compatibility files, so you need to download the original Mod as well.
		Black Market Bazaar
		Champion Bonanza
		Children of Storm


42. The Tactical Hotkeys / Action Bar don't always retain the Spells / Skills I assign them, anything I can do?

	a. Did you see "Rushing" on the Tactical Screen after using the Spell / Skill that disappeared from your Tactical Hotkeys / Action bar?

		a.1. Yes! Can it be fixed?
			No.

	b. It's a measure I had to put in to prevent cascading GoNext.

		b.1. Cascading GoNext?
			GoNext is XML for take another Action immediately.
			"Cascading" would be the capacity to chain GoNext one after the other, basically giving you numerous Actions in a row.

		b.2. What does this have to do w/ the Tactical Hotkeys?
			The GoNext feature is found in various unrelated Spells / Skills; the keyword here is 'unrelated'.
			Meaning a simple Cooldown, Mana, or Battle Wisdom requirement for one Spell / Skill wouldn't be sufficient to block it universally.
			The blocker I had to add makes it you simply don't know the Spell / Skill for 2 Actions (Current + Next).
			Which is why it disappears from your Tactical Hotkeys (Because you don't know it for 2 Actions).

		b.3. Ugh, why not leave it as it was before?
			The original "Rush" effect is designed to add 100 Initiative.
			What this actually does is it steals your next Action(s), giving you one immediately.
			Which means you aren't actually gaining a non-existent Action, you are just translating an upcoming Action into now.

		b.4. Sounds all theoretical.
			Maybe, but it has a very practical effect: if the enemy survives your ATK, it will take 2, 3, or more Actions before you get one again.
			In other words, Rush becomes much less desirable if it's +100 Initiative instead of GoNext.

		b.5. Which Skills and Spells are affected by this?
			It's probably not a complete list, but at least the following (Some of which are only found on Creatures):
				Battle Cry
				Beguile
				Blink (Vampire)
				Boar Charge
				Command
				Devour
				Enchanted Cobweb
				Epic Battle Cry
				Hatchet of Revolution
				I Shall Not Fall
				Leapfrogging
				Midas Flux
				Quick Draw
				Rescue
				Revenging Ring (Release)
				Rush [Any version of]
				Shadow Shift
				Spit Acid I
				Spit Acid II
				Spit Acid III
				Tangled Web
				Throwing Knife
				Tornado

		a.7. What if I didn't see "Rushing" on the Tactical Screen?
			Then report the issue, might or might not be something I can fix.


43. Some Tooltips are displaying 'string not found', is that suppose to happen?

	a. No, X_elemental.str file is suppose to take care of the missing strings; the file should be in your Data folder.
	...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\Data\X_elemental.str

		a.1. The file is there but I'm still seeing 'string not found'.
			If FELH is installed in the Default directory, let me know where you have 'string not found', I might have overlooked some.

			a.1.1. My FELH is installed in a Custom directory.
				For starter, I want to point out that I'm not sure how Mods will behave w/ your current installation.
				Limited testing seems to indicate a higher occurrence of crashes.
				As to the issue itself, you can move X_elemental.str to the local Core folder and the issue should disappear.
				C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\data\English\X_elemental.str
				or
				C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\data\English\X_elemental.str

			a.1.2. O.k., missing 'string not found' are fixed, but I still see a string of hashtags (###############) for some setup options.
				They are there to "remove/replace" a hardcoded Random/Custom setup option that is not compatible w/ XtraDeconstruct.


44. What happened to Stamina?

	a. Battle Wisdom is the equivalent of Stamina.

		a.1. Reason(s)?
			Stamina terminology is awkward as Stamina generally increases over a long training period, a situation not congruent w/ combat.
			Battle Wisdom, however, is a dynamic element w/ both short (Tactical) and long term aspects (Strategic).
			As well, Stamina is physical while Battle Wisdom is immaterial, which means a greater variety of elements can logically influence it.

				a.1.1. That last line wasn't necessarily logical.
					Don't worry, my logic is flexible.

		a.2. I see, did you consider other terms?
			Plenty, the finalists (emphasis needed here, even more terms were considered) were:
				Battle Wisdom
				Martial Power
				Aplomb
				Battle Tokens
				Tokens
				Focus
				Intensity
				Vigor
				Confidence
				Composure

		a.3. I like...
			Thanks, but no point suggesting anything else, I'm not changing it as doing so requires tracking the word(s) across multiple files.
			I did it once, that was enough.

				a.3.1. But I like...
					See previous answer.

					a.3.1.1. But I think the word you're looking for is Momentum or Adrenaline or...
						Frankly, the compound word I was looking for was Battle Wisdom, but I appreciate your suggestion.
						And I don't mean this as some sort of knee-jerk comment, I really do appreciate your suggestion.
						Make no mistake, feedback is very important for modders.
						Sometimes we, modders, can't or won't act upon it (as is the case here).
						But in order to take any mod to the next level, feedback is required.


45. Why are Guided (Faction Weakness) and Polymath (Sovereign Weakness) considered weaknesses?

	a. The Weakness category adds design points while the Strength category takes away points.

		a.1. So they're not really weaknesses?
			Indeed, just me bending XML rules.
			Thus, if you want a much stronger Custom Faction or Custom Sovereign without having to resort to modding, it's now possible.


46. Your Mod has more Empire Factions than Kingdom Factions.

	a. Yes.

		a.1. I get confused when people answer w/ only one word, save me?
			You can create (Kingdom) Factions quite easily using the Faction Creator.
			The Faction Creator can be accessed through the Workshop in FELH Start Menu.
			There are about 90 Faction Strengths and about 50 Faction Weaknesses.
			(Don't forget to Mod the Tech Tree if you create Custom Factions, See M1. (Modding)).

		a.2. Why don't you create them?
			There is little point for me to use the Faction Creator to create Factions, as you can do the same.
			Meaning I need to create Factions from the ground up and do something you can't do from the Faction Creator.
			This takes excessive amount of time, especially for the Faith Factions (Technically, I'm suppose to create an additional five of those).
			Meaning I'd rather work on other parts of the Mod, considering using the Faction Creator only takes a few minutes.

		a.3. But that still doesn't really answer the original statement about the imbalance between Empire and Kingdom Factions.
			Succinctly put, the imbalance is inconsequential.

		a.4. Inconsequential?
			In the "Who Opposes You?" Screen (After pressing "New Game"), you have an option to set the "Kingdom vs. Empire Balance".
			In other words, the sandbox game generator will give you what you want, even if the number of E/K Factions is not even to start w/.

		a.5. Speaking of Faith Factions...
			Faith Earth was added in 2.0.m!
			No idea if the other ones will make it some day, but I suspect Faith Water would be next, if only to balance out Faith Fire.
			There's always the possibility that the current version will be the last one, so don't get (too) excited...

			a.5.1. Why?!
				There's a number of reasons why there might not be another update, none of which really makes for good conversation.
				However, if the Mod is being downloaded and endorsed sufficiently, I'll keep going as long as I can.


47. Some in-game descriptions are flowery, but don't really tell much about what the item does.

	a. The Loot Screen pop up (and font) does not dynamically resize (much), so you can only fit a certain number of words.

		a.1. I see, but that still doesn't help understanding what the item does and isn't really a solution to the issue.
			You can hover over the item icon or the question mark (?) icon appearing in the Loot Screen pop up.
			Doing so will show the full XtraDeconstruct descriptions.
			Furthermore, if you click the question mark (?) icon (not simply hover over it), the Hiergamenon will open.
			You could also simply let the item go in your inventory and then read the full description from the inventory.


48. I haven't built the Forge of the Overlord, yet I have a -9.0 Relation Modifier (Forge of the Overlord)?

	(SPOILER)
	a. The -9.0 Relation Modifier is linked to the Tower of the Witch.

		a.1. Why?
			The AI needs time to mount an expedition against you for trying to win the game...
			Because the Relation Modifiers sum is cumulative, it could take numerous Seasons before the AI wants to declare war.
			Thus, the -9.0 must be given before you finished building the Forge of the Overlord.
			Do note that this isn't a Mod feature, it's from the Vanilla game and it's hardcoded to the Tower of the Witch.

		a.2. Meaning I can build the Tower of the Witch last and delay the Relation Modifier?
			Indeed.

		a.3. Can I change it back to 0.0 like it was in previous versions of the Mod?
			Yes you can!

				i. Find:
				...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\XtraDeconstruct\X_AI\XAI_Defs.xml

				ii. Edit w/ Notepad

				iii. Find the second "ForgeOfTheOverlord" (exact search, including quotes):
				<AIRelationsWeight InternalName="ForgeOfTheOverlord">

				iv. Edit Weight value from -9.0 to 0.0
				<Weight>-9.0</Weight>
				to
				<Weight>0.0</Weight>

		a.4. Why was it previously set at 0.0 'Is Spell of Making disabled?'

	b. It used to be impossible to play at higher levels (Ridiculous+) w/ Spell of Making Victory Condition enabled.

		b.1. That's not an answer to the question!
			In Vanilla LH, the AI will cast the Spell of Making within 100 Seasons if you play against Insane AI.
			Meaning you needed to play w/ Spell of Making Victory Condition disabled.
			But even if Spell of Making Victory Condition was disabled, you were still getting the -9.0 Relation Modifier.
			So I disabled it because I mostly play against Ridiculous+ AI.

		b.2. I know you want to say something more...
			I reactivated the penalty in 2.0.f. because it's now much harder to cast Spell of Making (You now need to control many Shards to do so).
			I reactivated the penalty in 2.0.f. because there's now good reasons to enable Spell of Making Victory Condition.

		b.3. What are those good reasons of yours, do tell me!
			Mod Tech Victory requires Spell of Making Victory Condition enabled.
			Mod Wonder Victory requires Spell of Making Victory Condition enabled.


49. Can I unlock all Unit Design Abilities at once in order to design more unit templates for future games?

	a. Not without cheats (or all Techs, obviously).

		a.1. O.k., how do I do that?
			There's a few different ways, but I like to use this one:

				i. Steam Library > FELH > Properties > Create Desktop Shortcut

				ii. Rename, e.g. LH (Cheat)

				iii. Right click Shortcut > Properties > Web Document > URL:

				iv. steam://rungameid/228260//Cheat

				v. Use that shortcut to start LH (Steam Interface may be needed in the background to properly see the Cheat Dialog Box)

				vi. In-game, use Ctrl+R to get all the Techs (Will also spawn a bunch of Champions), then create your unit designs

				vii. Exit game, restart LH through Steam (Not the cheat shortcut) and play against an AI using your own designs to steamroll you!


50. What is Grey Magic?

	a. Grey Magic is part of the UnitStat Background Mod (by Heavenfall) and added for compatibility reasons.

		a.1. Is there something using that specific Unit Stat?
			There's less than a handful of Abilities/Items/Spells using Grey Magic.
			However, it is prevalent throughout Abilities because you gain +1 for all Spellranks and most Spell Abilities.

		a.2. For something that widespread, it's a bit of a letdown there's isn't more than a handful of Abilities/Items/Spells using Grey Magic.
			The UnitStat Background Mod unlocks a basic set of Unit Stats for modders.
			It's up to modders to use it extensively.

		a.3. So you're to blame (again)?
			Sure (again)!
			I've added a few Grey Magic Items (and Abilities) in 2.0.g. and will keep adding them randomly, so there's now more than a handful.

		a.4. Which other Unit Stats are associated w/ the UnitStat Background Mod?
			http://forums.elementalgame.com/444737/

			UnitStat_BG_IsChampion
			UnitStat_BG_IsSovereign

			UnitStat_BG_IsRace_...

			UnitStat_BG_IsEmpire
			UnitStat_BG_IsKingdom

			UnitStat_BG_IsFemale
			UnitStat_BG_IsMale

			UnitStat_BG_IsHumanoid
			UnitStat_BG_IsMonster

			UnitStat_BG_IsBeast
			UnitStat_BG_IsConstruct

			UnitStat_BG_HasInjuries

51. I tried to charm a powerful Bandit/Beast/Construct/Dragon/Elemental/Twisted/Undead, but failed ten times in a row and got wrecked, what gives?

	a. Some Creatures are Immune to Magic while others are Immune to low-level Charm Spells.

		a.1. I know about Immune to Magic Creatures, you can't even cast on them; tell me more about Immune to low-level Charm Spells Creatures.
			Look for a grey (or blue) Unit Stat icon w/ a diamond picture (Is Adamant) in the Creature Unit Details.
			'Is Adamant' means the Creature is Immune to minor Charm Spells.
			Meaning only the Thralldom Spells can work on these.

		a.2. Thralldom Spells require at least Level 20, how am I suppose to get there?
			Play against Ludicrous amount of Expert+ Creatures and you will get there! (Medium+ Maps)

		a.3. I tried the Thralldom Spells on A/B/C/D/E/T/U Pioneers/Sovereigns and it didn't work.
			Pioneers and Sovereigns are Immune to enthralment in order to avoid issues.


52. I skipped an installation step (A1. Section) and now the Mod is not working properly.

	a. ...
		a.1. ...? You mean I shouldn't skip installation steps?
			...

		a.2. ...? Say something!
			Don't skip installation steps.


53. I found a treatise, but I already have that specific Tech, what will happen if I consume it?

	a. You will get additional tradable tech points, but no new Tech.

		a.1. Would I be better off selling it?
			Possibly.

		a.2. What will happen if I consume a treatise discussing a Tech not showing up in my Tech Tree?
			You will get additional tradable tech points, but no new Tech.

		a.3. How many treatises are there?
			17

			D. Elliot Lamb (a.k.a. davrovana) did.
			On top of being a modder, he's also an author:
				https://www.amazon.com/Ruler-Underworld-D-Elliot-Lamb/dp/1514726556/


54. What's the Channeler Clock?

	a. It's a Time-based Spell bonus for Sovereigns.

		a.1. Meaning?
			Some Spells will receive +1% every 4 Seasons if cast by a Sovereign (0.25% per Season).
			Thus, +100% after 400 Seasons and +250% after 1000 Seasons.

		a.2. +1% what, is that a Spell Damage bonus?
			It's a Spell effect bonus; can be damage or otherwise, depending on the Spell.

		a.3. Which Spells?
			The bonus is generally applied on some LH Spells and some XtraDeconstruct Spells.
			If you see, in the Spell extended description, "Time Bonus (Sov)", then it is one such Spell.
			For LH/XtraDeconstruct, Spell descriptions are up to date, so you can refer to them.
			For other Mods Spells, the Time-based Spell bonus for Sovereigns is generally not available.

		a.4. Some Tactical Spells have dynamic tooltips and no extended descriptions during combat...
			For these, there is no other way but to look in the Hiergamenon.


55. Is the Mod compatible w/ the Scenarios?

	a. Not likely, but I haven't tried; said otherwise, if you're about to spend 25+ hours doing the 1st or 2nd scenarios, you should do so w/ Vanilla LH.


56. Why can't I sign/ratify a Free Trade Agreement and/or a Janus Treaty and/or a Liege (Oath of fealty - Impost) despite meeting the requirements?

	a. There is a limit to the number of MOD treaties you can have.

		a.1. So I can't break an Alliance w/ a Janus Treaty if I already have an FTA?
			I don't think so, but the FTA expires after 99 Seasons.
			Thus you could cancel the Alliance w/ a Janus Treaty once the FTA expires.

		a.2. Are you sure about that treaty limit?
			Somewhat, but if anything in this section (or elsewhere for that matter) is wrong, let me know which/how and I will correct it.


57. What happens w/ predetermined Empire/Kingdom Unit Stats if I create a Kingdom Faction w/ an Empire Race (Blood) or vice versa?

	a. As per Heavenfall, the UnitStat Background Mod creator, the Unit Stats are not inherent from the Faction but from the Race.

		a.1. Heh?
			From the perspective of the UnitStat Background Mod, a Race is Kingdom or Empire and that never changes.
			e.g. The Men Race (Altarian) will always be considered Kingdom no matter what.

		a.2. So what happens when something does additional damage vs Empire or Kingdom, say Warrior Enmity?
			Should work out fine as these are using the <vsOtherAllegiance> tag which has nothing to do w/ the UnitStat Background Mod.
			Otherwise and generally speaking, it should be fine; there might be exceptions, but I'm not sure they're worth tracking.
			Do report any such issue if you think you've run into one.


58. Why are islands sometimes spawning on the outskirt of the map?

	a. I believe it's a Battlegrounds DLC (DLC06) issue, more precisely, I believe it has to do w/ DLC06 Huge Stamps.

		a.1. Stamps?
			Stamps are used to generate random maps.
			They are like pieces of a puzzle.

		a.2. So what about DLC06 Huge Stamps?
			All Core Huge Stamps are regular, that is, 51x35 tiles.
			All DLC06 Huge Stamps are irregular, w/ the two biggest being 53x50 and 56x41.

		a.3. So these DLC06 Stamps have islands?
			No (Well, maybe), but I believe random maps have a finite amount of land that can fit.
			Anything extending beyond that limit is turned into Ocean tiles for a few tiles...
			And then, whatever wasn't changed into Ocean tiles remains as land, thus creating the islands.

		a.4. Can you fix it?
			I did implement an XML fix that reduces the amount of encroachment beyond the land limit.
			It also, generally, prevents Stamps from colliding w/ the map border.
			Finally, said fix reduces the amount of beaches (Beaches aren't supposed to spawn at all; it's all supposed to be Cliffs).
			However, to truly fix this, I would have to redo the DLC06 Stamps and that's not going to happen.

		a.5 Meh...
			You can fully disable DLC06 if you wish.
			Steam > Library > FELH > Right-Click > Properties > DLC > Battlegrounds DLC > UNCHECK
			However, realize that unless a Faction spawns on an island, said islands aren't going to be game breaking.
			(I want to emphasis the irony here, as just after writing this, I played a game and an AI Faction spawned on an island...).

		a.6. Is this DLC also responsible for creating abrupt / linear water borders in awkward places / between stamps?
			I believe so.

		a.7. Is this DLC also responsible for some Wildlands being "broken", such as when the Lombard Desert Mountain Walls are "razed"?
			I believe so.

		a.8. You're lucky Stardock has broad shoulders and is there to take all the blame...
			I believe so.


59. I tried to cast A/D/E/F/L/W Paramountcy or Spell so and so, but all I got was this loosy warning: "Spell Channeling Canceled".

	a. Strategic Spells w/ a cast time equal or greater than 1 will end up being "channeled" through your army leader instead of the caster.

		a.1. And?
			If your army leader does not meet the spell requirements, then the spell fails and you will get the pop-up.

		a.2. Anything you can do?
			Not really, but there are things you can do!
			Basically, either make sure the caster is the army leader or the army leader has the spell requirements even if not casting.
			If that's not possible, then move the caster out of the army, alone, until he/she/it finishes casting the spell.


60. Where is the Meditation spell?

	a. Meditation is integrated in CityHubs, meaning you no longer need to cast it, it is done automatically.


61. Why does Deorcnysse not grow when I conquer it?

	a. If you're using a Custom Faction, that Faction MUST have "Deorcnysse Secrets" Faction Strength (Selectable when you create a new Faction, 0 point).

		a.1. I'm not using a Custom Faction.

	b. When you start a New Game, set your "World Difficulty" settings at Normal, Challenging, Hard, Expert, Ridiculous, or Insane.

		b.1. I was hoping for an explanation.

	c. It's a long story.

		c.1. I've got time, how does it starts?
			A long time ago, in an office in Michigan...

		c.2. O.k., I don't have THAT much time.
			Deorcnysse is a Wildland City w/ a growing problem.
			IF it's not conquered by YOU or an AI soon enough, it will likely skip City Specialization.

		c.3. Uh-oh.
			Skipping City Specialization means it will grow by +1 City Size every X Seasons (Could even be every Season).
			In other words, it could well reach City Level 100+.
			In turn, this will completely break the Faction Power Rankings and by extension, Diplomacy.

		c.4. Thanks, I've heard enough about that, now what about my problem?

	d. In order to fix the City Specialization issue, I had to reduce Deorcnysse Grains to 0 until conquered.

		d.1. O.k., but why doesn't it grow when I conquer it?
			At World Difficulty Normal or more, Deorcnysse has +7 Grains per Season.
			At World Difficulty Easy or less, Deorcnysse has +2 Grains per Season.

		d.2. I almost have no Attention Span Points left.
			The fix reduces Grains by 7 (Until conquered by an AI or Player), no matter the World Difficulty you select.
			Thus, Deorcnysse has -5 Grains at World Difficulty Easy or less.
			Translating to -125 Food per Season [-5 x 25 = -125].
			Basically, by the time you conquer Deorcnysse (at Easy or less), the population will likely be negative, by a rather large number.

		d.3. So?
			So Deorcnysse IS growing, no matter what, when you conquer it.
			However, its population is likely less than 0 if you're playing at World Difficulty Easy (or less) and you first need to get it to 0.

		d.4. Why isn't there a 0 population floor?
			There is one, sort of, but my fix bypasses it.

		d.5. O.k., so setting my World Difficulty at Normal (or more) will fix that?
			Yes.
			Don't forget to select "Deorcnysse Secrets" Faction Strength IF you're creating a Custom Faction.

		d.6 Despite your claims that Deorcnysse is fixed, it's not...
			Added an additional fix in 2.0.k.; to reach Deorcnysse Level 2, 300 population is now required instead of 50.

			d.6.1. Despite your claims that Deorcnysse is fixed, it's not...
			Added additional fixes in 2.0.m. and 2.0.n. which should impair Deorcnysse growth even more until conquered.

				d.6.1.1. Despite your claims that Deorcnysse is fixed, it's not...
				If it's still not fixed, I guess I can't fix it.
				I'd recommend razing it if, when you conquer it, it has skipped specialization.


62. Can I create Custom Factions using Children of Storm (CoS) Races?

	a. As of 2.0.k., ALL Children of Storm Races can be used to create Custom Factions.

		a.1. !!!
			Below are the required traits, if any, that you need to select to create a CoS Race Custom Faction.

				NO SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
				Angel Race
				Elf Race
				Gnome Race
				Golem Race
				Living Stone Race
				Lizardman Race
				Undead Race

				SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
				Centaur Race requires the Faction Strength 'Centaur Bases'
				Chaos Legion Race requires the Faction Strength 'Chaos Legion Bases'
				Frost Giant Race requires the Faction Strength 'Frost Giant Bases'
				Shadow Race requires the Faction Strength 'Shadow Bases'

				RECOMMENDED BUT NOT REQUIRED
				Drota Race should select Gourmet (Faction Weakness)

		a.2. So what are all those "Race" Worshippers Faction Strengths?
			They are amalgamates of the previous CoS Races associated traits.
			Most were too small to be standalone Faction Strengths or Weaknesses so doing it like that is cleaner and faster.
			Technically, they are NOT Race specific and should be usable by any Race (Hence the "worshippers" term).

		a.3. Any caveats?
			CoS Rivermod isn't integrated for CoS Custom Factions, probably won't be any time soon, but you never know.
			Meaning CoS Custom Factions will always be a little bit different than the original ones.
			Minimal testing was done, hopefully making it error-free, but do report any issue you find.

69. Rodent Repellent (or Spell so and so) is tagged as a Tactical Spell whereas it should be Strategic and/or generally speaking some information seems wrong?

	a. See FAQ #68, above; in this specific case, Rodent Repellent is a Black Market Bazaar spell.


70. Where have the Path of the Mage and the Path of the Warrior gone?

	a. There's now 12 paths available, alphabetically ordered; the original leveling screen only shows the first five: Assassin, Bard, Commander, Defender, Gravelord.

		a.1. I guess that's my question?
			Scroll down once to see Paths #6-#10 (Mage, Paladin, Ranger, Shaman, Sorcerer)
			Scroll down twice to see Paths #11-#12 (Warrior, Zero)

		a.2. Can I see all 12 on the same screen?
			Yes you can! Let's make LH great again. See section:
			H8. (UI\Optional) - XW_TraithPathChoiceWnd & XW_TraitPathChoiceWnd_2_Rows

		a.3. My LH game is installed in a custom directory.
			See FAQ #95.


71. Is the modded UI working properly since the 4k update (LH 2.1)?

	a. More or less.

		a.1. More more or more less?
			Modded DXPACK work fine if you use Small UI.
			In the Main Menu, go to Options, find UI Scale, then select Small.

		a.2. My LH game is installed in a custom directory.
			See FAQ #95.


95. My LH game is installed in a custom directory, anything I should be aware of?

	a. It will make mod installation (even more) byzantine.

		a.1. Oh noes! How bad is it?
			I'm not sure.

		a.2. O.k., well, what do you know?
			The STR files won't work properly.
			The DXPACK files won't work properly.
			And then, there's the unknown unknowns, feel free to report them if you encounter them.

		a.3. Are there workarounds for the STR and DXPACK files?
			Yes.

			As explained in FAQ #43, you can move X_elemental.str file from the mod folder:
			...\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\Data\X_elemental.str
			to your custom installation directory (adjust as needed):
			C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\data\English\X_elemental.str
			C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\data\English\X_elemental.str

			For DXPACK files, you need to install them first, as explained in sections H1. to H10.
			Then delete everything in:
			C:\ProgramData\Stardock\Elemental - Legendary Heroes\Screens\
			When you start LH, the screens list will be rebuilt.

	b. The game might crash even more.

		b.1. Oh noes! How bad is it?
			Limited testing wasn't enjoyable duh to numerous crashes, I went back to normal Steam installation.


96. I found typographical and grammar errors, should I just ignore them?

	a. NOO GOD! NO. GOD. PLEASE. NO. NO!!! NO!!! NOOOOOO!!! Totally report them. I know I would...


97. Do you need a graphic designer or a 3D artist to help you out?

	a. I certainly do, contact me.

		a.1. I have other talents that could be useful to modding...
			Contact me through Stardock Messenger, we'll see, no promises.
			http://forums.elementalgame.com/pm/new/5505675

		a.2. I can perform a backbend.
			Cherry would be proud.


98. I have a bug report, a suggestion, general feedback, constructive criticism, etc. How do I go about it?

	a. You can post any and all of those in my XtraDeconstruct thread
	http://forums.elementalgame.com/451107/page/87/#0

		a.1. I'd rather keep this private
			Send me a Private Message (Primal_Savage)
			http://forums.elementalgame.com/pm/new/5505675


99. Something somewhere somehow?

	a. There are known knowns, there are known unknowns, and there are unknown unknowns.


100. I'd like to make a donation.

	a. Please donate to UNICEF. [ http://support.unicef.org/ ]

		a.1. Oh...
			I'd be happy if you mention your donation in my XtraDeconstruct thread.
			http://forums.elementalgame.com/451107/page/87/#0

		a.2. Oh...
			I'm also good if you'd rather simply send me a Private Message!
			http://forums.elementalgame.com/pm/new/5505675

		a.3. Oh...
			I'm quite fine too if you want to keep this between you and yourself...

X1. (Hiergamenon) - XtraDeconstruct Manual
____________________________________________________________________


0. Preamble

	XtraDeconstruct (XD) expands LH in a myriad of ways.

	I've given up trying to come up with a complete Manual as XtraDeconstruct changes way too many things to explain everything in details.

	I also feel the various sections of this text file and the various othert text files cover a sufficient amount of material to act as a substitute Manual.

	At any rate, if you're eternally patient, content may be added at various points before the end of the current eon.

I.1. Conventions
I.1.1. Abilities & Equipment
	These categories are usually alphabetically ordered (Except for INJURY, !SHENANIGANS!, and !WARNING!, which are usally found at the very end or beginning).

	ABSTRACT
	A summary of what the Ability or piece of Equipment does.
	Can also be a short story about said Ability or Equipment.
	Generally absent for Abilities.
	Generally present for Equipment.

	CORE
	Attack, Defense, or Initiative values.
	In the case of Equipment, the main Attack or Defense component is generally shown before ABSTRACT as it is the main component.

	DESIGN
	Relates to Faction creation, Sovereign creation, or Unit creation.

	IMPROVEMENTS
	Information about buildings that can be build or not by a Faction.

	INCOME
	Tax information.

	IMMUNITY
	Immunity information.
	In the case of Elemental Immunities (e.g. Fire), this generally means the Unit has +200% Resistance to said Element.
		Do note that 200% is used instead of 100% so that debuffs and vulnerabilities do not remove the immunities; one is either immune or is not.
		NOTE: It seems I've moved the Elemental Immunities in the Resistance section at some point in time; they now indicate +200%.

	INJURY
	Injury information.
	Generally found at the end.

	MOVEMENT
	Movement modifiers information.
	In the case of Mounts, Movement is generally shown before ABSTRACT as it is the main component.

	PATH
	Path Information; this isn't really relevant to the player other than to say the Unit already has a Path, but the Unit Stat is needed for game mechanics.

	PRODUCTION
	Production cost modifiers

	RECRUITMENT
	Champion/Creatures recruitment modifiers.

	REGENERATION
	Strategic regeneration is defined as "per Season".
	Tactical regeneration is defined as "per Action".

	RESEARCH
	Research bonus information.

	RESISTANCE
	Resistance information, generally less than 100%, otherwise it would fall into the Immunity category.
		NOTE: It seems I moved the Elemental Immunities in the Resistance section at some point in time; they now indicate +200%.

	RESOURCES
	Resource production information.

	SHOP
	Sell value modifiers.

	SKILL
	Equipment granting Abilities.

	SPELL POTENCY
	Spell "damage" bonuses.
	You can find the relevant Spell "damage" bonuses in the Spell Descriptions; generally indicated as follow:
		Air Multiplier
		Chaos Multiplier
		Death Multiplier
		Earth Multiplier
		Fire Multiplier
		Life Multiplier
		Order Multiplier
		Water Multiplier
	Do note that this information is manually added to Spell Descriptions and is sometimes missing.
	Sadly, there's only so much I can do in a day and this one thing is particularly low on my list of interesting things to do w/ my life.
	As of 2.0.h., I would think ALL LH + XtraDeconstruct Spells are up-to-date (Both Strategic/Tactical); only preloaded/compatible Mods are not.

	SPELLCASTING EFFECT
	Effects happening when you cast a Spell.

	SPELLRANK
	Information relating to Magic schools.

	SPELLS
	Generally indicates Spells that are available in both Strategic or Tactical.
	Is also used, especially for Spellranks, to group multiple Spells instead of splitting them in Strategic/Tactical Spells categories (When laziness strikes).

	STATS
	Various - generally less important - Unit Stats.

	STRATEGIC EFFECT
	Effects that only happen in Strategic Mode (or are meaningless in Tactical Mode).

	STRATEGIC ITEM
	Consumable usable in Strategic Mode.

	STRATEGIC SPELLS
	Unlocks Strategic Spells.

	SUMMONS
	Bonuses that apply specifically to Summons.

	TACTICAL ABILITY
	Can be found by clicking the "Skills" button in Tactical and then selecting the appropriate Ability.

	TACTICAL ACTION
	Can be activated by pressing the "Pass" button.

	TACTICAL AUTOCAST
	Spells that are automatically cast at the beginning of every battle.

	TACTICAL EFFECT
	Effects happening in Tactical without any input from the Player.

	TACTICAL ITEM
	Can be found by clicking the "Items" button in Tactical and then selecting the appropriate Item.

	TACTICAL MELEE ATK
	Happens on successful Melee Attack by you. If no precision is given, +Effects benefit the attacker while -Effects apply to the defender.

	TACTICAL MELEE DEF
	Happens on successful Melee Attack by the Enemy. If no precision is given, +Effects benefit the defender while -Effects apply to the attacker.

	TACTICAL SPECIAL
	Does not fit other Tactical categories, but is related to Tactical.

	TACTICAL SPELLS
	Can be found by clicking the "Spells" button in Tactical and then selecting the appropriate Spell.

	TREASURE
	Percentage modifier to the chance of finding better items when looting Goodie Huts and Lairs.

	UNITS
	Additional starting units.

	WAGES
	Wage modifiers information.

	WONDERS
	Information about unique world buildings that can be build or not by a Faction.

	XOTIC
	Exotic stuff (eXOTIC); generally under the hood stuff that finds its way in the Description because of how XML works.
	Random UnitStats with little informative value to Players. (e.g. UnitStat_IsShield will be ::: Is Shield).

	XTRA
	This is only used for the +18 Initiative bonus found in XtraDeconstruct.

	!SHENANIGANS!
	Under the hood stuff that I'd rather keep secret!
	Most of the time, it would be beyond useless for the Player to know about this...

	!WARNING!
	Various warnings (e.g. Crash Warnings, Incompatibilities, etc.).


I.2. Icon Colors
	Icon colors are used as follow (Loosely applied):

I.2.1. Abilities
	BLUE
	Individual Defensive Abilities or Autocast Defensive Spells.

	BRONZE
	Blockers (Most of which are not seen by the Player) 
	Some Talents (Some of which will slowly be moved to the right colors in due time).

	GREEN
	Special Abilities requiring activation (e.g. Skills Button).
	99.9% of the time, you should see TACTICAL ABILITY in the description of said ability.
	If you don't see Tactical Ability, it's probably a mistake.

	GREY
	Background UnitStats.
	Mostly useful to understand how your abilities/equipment/spells can be used against specific opponents.

	ORANGE
	Indidivual Offensive Abilities or Autocast Offensive Spells.

	PURPLE
	Spells or Spells related, excluding Defensive/Offensive/Army Autocast Spells (Blue/Orange/Yellow), Skill Spells (Green), or Consumable Spells (Consumable Icon).
	Given time, I would likely and eventually move many (Blue) Mage abilities to that color, since I think they should use Purple, not Blue...

	RED
	Injuries or Weaknesses.

	TEAL
	Creatures or AI specific.

	YELLOW
	Army Abilities or Army Tactical Autocast, most (Faction) Player Abilities, or Strategic Abilities.

I.2.2. Spells
	BLACK
	Faction Mass Spells or Map Mass Spells.

	BRONZE
	Army Mass Spells.

	SILVER
	Beneficial or Defensive Spells.

	PINK
	Harmful or Offensive Spells.

I.2.3. Additional Comments
	Not all modders follow these conventions rigorously or at all. Deviations are also found in Vanilla Legendary Heroes. Consequently, this should be used as a guide only.

	Also note that some Abilities have no icon color at all (Transparent); whenever I found one (and feel like it) I usually give it an icon color.

	Nevertheless, if you believe I've miscategorized an Ability or Spell using the wrong color, let me know and I'll do my best to fix it in a timely manner.


I.3. Loot Colors

	RANDOM LOOT
	Common (Pastel Gray)
	Uncommon (Urobilin)

	After testing various methods, XtraDeconstruct 2.0.c. introduces crafting.

	Because the Forging/Enchanting Spells promise to be numerous, they are not Hiergamenon-enabled so as to not clutter the encyclopedia.

III.1. Requirements
	First, you need a Champion/Sovereign with +1 'Forging Power'.
	+1 Forging Power is given when Crafting for Dummies is consumed.
	+1 Forging Power is given when Governor is selected.
	+1 Forging Power is given when Path of the Commander is selected.

	Then, you need a Champion/Sovereign with +1 'Enchanting Power'.
	+1 Enchanting Power is given for any of the A/D/E/F/L/W Master Spell Ranks.

	Having any (or all) will work.

	Note that the same Champion/Sovereign can have both Forging Power and Enchanting Power (and/or Alchemy Power and/or ...).

	You need Arcanium, which comes in 6 different varieties (Green, Grey, Orange, Purple, Red, and Yellow).
	Arcanium is a random loot item (It's often found on Shrills I'm told!) or it can be produced in some cases or it can be magically created.
	Arcanium Bonuses:
		Green: +Earth [Beekeeper, Gravitational, Mimetic, Mountainous, Seismic, Predatory]

III.2. How-to
III.2.0. Generalities
	Some Crafting Designs (Forge Spells) are unlocked by way of acquiring Forging Power.
	Some Crafting Designs (Forge Spells) are unlocked by way of acquiring Forging Power + a particular Tech.
	Some Crafting Designs (Forge Spells) are unlocked by way of acquiring Forging Power + Plate Smithing Power + a particular Tech.
	Some Crafting Designs (Forge Spells) are unlocked by way of acquiring Forging Power + Accumulated Research + Master Spell Rank + a particular Tech

	Crafting Enchantments (Enchant Spells) are unlocked by a combination of Arcanium Resource, Enchanting Power (or Alchemy Power for Potions), and a Spell-specific UnitStat.
	The Spell-specific UnitStat is acquired by consuming a Forged Item.

III.2.1. Step #1
	Whenever you loot Arcanium, you should crush it (Consume it).
	This will increase your Crushed Arcanium resources by 1.
	Crushed Arcanium is used to enchant items.

III.2.2. Step #2
	Your Champion/Sovereign with Forging Power needs to create Forged Items, such as a 'Forged Short Sword'.
	This is done by casting a Forge Spell, see 'Crafting #Forging' category in your Spellbook (Anvil Icon).

III.2.3. Step #3
	Your Champion/Sovereign with Enchanting Power (or Alchemy Power for Potions or Collar "Power" for Collars) must then consume the Forged Item, which unlocks a series of Enchant Spells.
	(e.g. All 'Enchant Short Sword (...)' Spells are unlocked by consuming a Forged Short Sword).
	Note that no Enchanting Spells will show up as available as long as you don't also have the required Crushed Arcanium.

III.2.4. Step #4
	Your Champion/Sovereign with Enchanting Power (or Alchemy Power for Potions or Collar "Power" for Collars or ...) can then create a new 'Enchanted Item'.
	(e.g. Short Sword of Bane).
	This is done by casting an Enchanting Spell, see 'Crafting #Enchanting' category in your Spellbook (Star Icon).

	To cast Enchanting I Spells, you need 1 Enchanting Power and 1 Arcanium.
	To cast Enchanting II Spells, you need 2 Enchanting Power and 2 Arcanium of the same type.
	To cast Enchanting III Spells, you need 3 Enchanting Power and 3 Arcanium of the same type.
	To cast Enchanting IV Spells, you need 4 Enchanting Power and 4 Arcanium of the same type.
	To cast Enchanting V Spells, you need 5 Enchanting Power and 5 Arcanium of the same type.
	To cast Enchanting VI Spells, you need 6 Enchanting Power and 6 Arcanium of the same type.
	NOTE1: Arcanium values are halved when enchanting Daggers.
	NOTE2: This is a general pattern, some items do not follow it.
	NOTE3: No Enchanting VI Spells currently available, but some Reagent Spells can require up to 6 Arcaniums.

IV. Pioneers & Logistics
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

IV.0. Preamble
	Pioneer Production Effort (Pre-XtraDeconstruct 2.0.d. Resource) redesigned: now Logistics.

	Logistics prevents AI from creating Pioneer Armies.

	Logistics prevents Player from using the Queued Pioneer Exploit.

IV.1. How-to acquire Logistics
	Logistics can be acquired if you build the Expansion Bureau (+1) or the Tower of Dominion (+1). The Expansion Satellite Spell also provides +1.

	Thus, you can only have a total of 3 Logistics, unless you acquire the capacity to build more of these buildings when conquering other Factions.

	It's also possible to acquire some additional Pioneers over that limit through Quests and other means.

	AI get an extra Logistics point through the Thinking Machine Advantage, but never casts Expansion Satellite.

IV.2. What to do with Logistics?
	Logistics is not accumulated, it is renewed every Season.

	Logistics will be displayed beside other Resources at the top of the screen (The white four-wheeled carriage).

	Existing Pioneers use 1 Logistics until they are killed, disbanded, used to create a City, or used to create an Outpost.

	Pioneers in training use 1 Logistics while queued; cancelling said Pioneer returns 1 Logistics Resource to the Logistics Total.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
I. Preamble
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	This mod started in September 2013 as a single xml file - XtraTaxRatesDefs - dividing Tax Rates in 5% brackets.
	(That file survived for over 30 editions of the Mod, until it was replaced by another file when 2.0.h was released in June 2016)

	It gradually expanded to a series of standalone "Xtra" files modifying various aspects of the game.

	In February 2014, I decided to reunite all the files together (Around 60 at the time) and created XtraDeconstruct.

	While XtraDeconstruct was meant to be modular, it has grown exponentially (Full installation is over 500 .xml/.txt/.dxpack files and 2500 .png/.dds files).

	This section should help you understand which files act as Standalone Mods.

	Standalone Mods can be removed without breaking the foundation of XtraDeconstruct.

	IMPORTANT:
	You can always REMOVE a Standalone Mod from XtraDeconstruct.
	But you probably won't be able to ADD a Standalone Mod on it's own to your Mod collection since Standalone files use material found in other XtraDeconstruct files.



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
II. How-to
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	To avoid problems you should consider all files not mentioned in 'III. XtraDeconstruct Standalone Mods' as essential until further notice.

	The Standalone files can simply be deleted if you don't want to use them.

	Files w/ a [ALPHA] tag are likely working as intended, but will most likely need additional tweaking.
	Files w/ a [BETA] tag are likely working as intended, but may need additional tweaking.

	Take note that I will not discuss .dxpack files here as they have their own sections. That being said, the .dxpack files are Standalone Mods within the limits set forth in their respective .txt files.

	IMPORTANT:
	If you are using Compatibility Files, you may need to track the associated Compatibility Files equivalent to fully remove a Standalone Mod. I may add the relevant references in subsequent updates.
	(EDIT: References added)

III. XtraDeconstruct Standalone Mods

	As of 1.8.d., XtraDeconstruct is entering a new era which has me reordering, renaming, and redesigning files.

I. Basics
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I.0. Preamble

	Modding is fun! ["Losing is fun!" -Dwarf Fortress]

	It's also challenging in many ways and can be frustating at times, especially when you can't find help.

	While this isn't meant to be an all-encompassing guide to modding, I hope it will help new LH modders out there.


I.1. Enabling Mods in LH

	1. Start LH
	2. Select Options
	3. Check 'Use Mods'
	4. Restart LH


I.2. Find your LH folder

	Your LH folder should be on your C:\ drive in the Steam folder. More precisely, if you are running Windows 7 64-bit:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\
	or
	C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\


I.3. Find your LH Mods folder

	Your LH Mods folder should be in your Documents folder:
	C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\LegendaryHeroes\Mods\

	Where USERNAME needs to be replaced by your Windows session username.

	This is where your modding files should generally be saved.


I.4. Modding Tools
I.4.1. XML

	Extensible Markup Language, also known as XML, is a fairly simple programming language.

	It's very textual, to the point where you would have no problem modding in Notepad.

	While using Notepad is quite doable, I would suggest using some of the more advanced softwares out there, such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text.

	Personally, I use Notepad++, which is a free software under GNU General Public Licence:
	https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

	If you install Notepad++, you may also want to install 'XML Tools' plugin.
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/XML%20Tools/

	Most relevant .xml files are found in the following directory:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\data\English\
	or
	C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\data\English\

	However, more .xml files can be found if you browse the various folders found in the data folder:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\data\
	or
	C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\data\


1.4.2. Gfx

	Graphics files formats in LH are .png (Portable Network Graphics) and .dds (DirectDraw Surface).

	Most Icons and Medallions are .png files so that's probably what you will be working with more often than not.

	Most Textures are .dds files, but you can get away with creating textures as .png files although they might end up taking more disk space (and memory).

	People use a variety of softwares to edit graphics. GIMP and Paint.NET are popular choices. Microsoft Paint and Microsoft Picture Manager can also be used.

	Personally I use a bit of everything, but I often end up using Pixlr Editor which is available online, is free, and has many powerful advanced tools.

	Most gfx are found in the following directory:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\Gfx\
	or
	C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\Gfx\


1.4.3. Interface

	DesktopX, a Stardock software, was used to create the user interface in LH.

	It used to be possible to buy and/or download the software from Stardock Website, but I don't believe that's still the case.

	Nevertheless, if you happen to have said software installed on your computer, you can use it to modify interface files, also known as .dxpack files.

	It's not a really complicated software to use, but if you want to read more about it, a DesktopX Guide can be found online:
	http://www.stardock.com/products/desktopx/help/

	Most .dxpack files are found in the following directory:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\screens\
	or
	C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\screens\


1.4.4. Models

	3D model files are .hkb files, which is about the same as Havok .hkx files.

	You used to be able to download Havok Content Tools 7.1.0 (32 bit) for free from "Try Havok" in order to see the models and their characteristics.

	However, Microsoft purchased Havok from Intel in October 2015 and they've removed that possibility.

	At the moment, your best bet to get further information regarding 3D modelling is to search and ask around on Stardock Elemental forums.

	Most .hkb files are found in the following directory:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\Gfx\HKB\
	or
	C:\GOG Games\Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes\Gfx\HKB\


1.4.5. Other

	There are other tools and Websites that might end up being useful to a modder. Among which:

	https://www.dropbox.com/
	Can be used to backup your files or share them.

	http://www.nexusmods.com/fallenenchantresslegendaryheroes/
	NexusMods is the most used Website to share FELH Mods.

	http://postimage.org/
	An excellent image hosting Website.

	Note that Steam Workshop is not supported where FELH Modding is concerned.

II. Understanding Kumquat Modding
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

II.0. What is Kumquat?
	
	Kumquat has been the Elemental series Stardock developed engine until now.

	Different Kumquat iterations have been used for War of Magic (2010), Fallen Enchantress (2012), FE:Legendary Heroes (2013), and Sorcerer King (2015/2016).

	Stardock initially planned to keep using Kumquat until at least 2017, but I believe Sorcerer King: Rivals will be the last game to use it in the Elemental series.

	According to Stardock, the next game in the series will likely be powered by Oxide Nitrous engine, which is used in Ashes of the Singularity.


II.1. Modding from the Core folder or from the Mods folder?

	Most players will start modifying XML in what I call the Core folder, which is the local FELH Steam \English\ folder where all the core XML files are.

	That's fine when you don't intend to actually share your Mods or use any other Mods.

	On the contrary, it's anything but fine if you do intend to share your Mods or use multiple Mods.

	While complexity is slighty increased by modding from the Mods folder, compatibility is also increased.

	Most relevant changes that can be made in the Core folder can also be made in the Mods folder, it's a matter of understanding how XML Types are processed.


II.2. XML Types interpretation
II.2.1. Theory

	Kumquat interprets XML main tags four different ways: 100%, Mixed, Preserved, and Protected.

	100%:
	Using a known InternalName creates a blank slate as far as XML is concerned, effectively resetting the Core XML for that specific InternalName.

	Mixed:
	By far the largest category, could be divided in subcategories. For a known InternalName, some/most XML is preserved, but you can overwrite most/some.

	Preserved:
	For a known InternalName, XML is preserved, but you can add to it.

	Protected:
	Cannot modify the XML of a known InternalName.


II.2.2. Applied
