		<DisplayName>Philosopher's Stone (Failed)</DisplayName>
		<Description>This wasn't supposed to be a complicated assignment. You gathered the best Alchemists from all over Elemental and told them to make you a Philosopher's Stone, as described on an ancient scroll found in the ruins of Al-Ashteroth. What could go wrong?
		
		When one of your messenger - Murphy - collapsed, breathless, in your throne room, you knew something was wrong: a thundering explosion had destroyed the Alchemist Lab, all Alchemists were dead, and the Al-Ashteroth scroll was nowhere to be found.
		
		The messenger did have good news, saying that a stone had indeed been created. However, your elation was short-lived once you learned that the stone was anything but rufescent and as big as a small Slag.
		
		To top it off, Alchemist notes found in the lab ruins made no mention of creating Gildar. Instead, the notes look as if they were written by mana-intoxicated Channelers.
		
		Just as your were about to dismiss the messenger, he added that a large sum of Gildar had gone missing from the City's coffins.
		
		Apparently, anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
		
		Following that disastrous enterprise, you decided to divert some alchemist funds toward science scholarships.
