		<TutorialText>
		0. Preamble
		After testing various methods, XtraDeconstruct 2.0.c. introduces crafting. Because the Forging/Enchanting Spells promise to be numerous, they are not Hiergamenon-enabled so as to not clutter the encyclopedia.
		
		1. Requirements
		First, you need a Champion with +1 'Forging Power'.
		+1 Forging Power is given when Crafting for Dummies is consumed.
		+1 Forging Power is given when Governor is selected.
		+1 Forging Power is given when Path of the Commander is selected.
		+1 Forging Power is given when Tinker is selected.
		+1 Forging Power is given when you have an Astral Forge (Accessory).
		+1 Forging Power is given when a Champion is stationed in a city w/ a Blacksmith.
		+1 Forging Power is given when a Champion is stationed in a city w/ the Forge of the Overlord.
		Having any (or all) will work.
		
		Then, you need a Champion with +1 'Enchanting Power'.
		+1 Enchanting Power is given for any of the A/D/E/F/L/W Master Spell Ranks.
		+1 Enchanting Power is given when Enchanter is selected.
		+1 Enchanting Power is given when Path of the Mage is selected.

		+1 Alchemy Power is given when a Champion is stationed in a city w/ an Alchemist.
		+1 Alchemy Power is given when a Champion is stationed in a city w/ an Alchemy Lab.

		Having any (or all) will work.
		
		OR a Champion with +1 'Plate Smithing Power' to forge Plate Armor.
		+1 Plate Smithing Power is given when Plate Mail Proficiency (Path of the Defender) is selected.
		+1 Plate Smithing Power is given when you equip Brokkr's Pliers.

		Iron Collar (Geomancy)
		Primordial Collar (Summon III)
		Scale Collar (Volcanic Rites)
		Studded Collar (Summon Wisp)
		Having any (or all) will work.
		
		Note that the same Champion can have Forging Power, Enchanting Power, Alchemy Power, etc.
		
		You also need Arcanium, which comes in 6 different varieties (Green, Grey, Orange, Purple, Red, and Yellow).
		Arcanium is a random loot item (It's often found on Shrills I'm told!) or it can be produced in some cases or it can be magically created.
		
		Arcanium Bonuses:
		Green: +Earth [Beekeeper, Gravitational, Mimetic, Mountainous, Seismic, Predatory]
		Grey: +Water\Cold [Numbing, Coralline, Gelid, Tidal, Hyperborean, Tsunamic]
		Orange: +Death\Poison [Baneful, Degenerative, Tormenting, Malignancy, Decayed, Putrescent]

		Red: +Fire [Radiant, Scorching, Igneous, Magmatic, Devouring, Conflagrant]
		Yellow: +Air [Shimmering, Tempestuous, Stormful, Cyclonic, Thundering, Iridescent]
		
		2. How-to
		2.0. Generalities
		Some Crafting Designs (Forge Spells) are unlocked by way of acquiring Forging Power.
		Some Crafting Designs (Forge Spells) are unlocked by way of acquiring Forging Power + a particular Tech.
		Some Crafting Designs (Forge Spells) are unlocked by way of acquiring Forging Power + Plate Smithing Power + a particular Tech.
		Some Crafting Designs (Forge Spells) are unlocked by way of acquiring Forging Power + Accumulated Research + Master Spell Rank + a particular Tech
		
		Crafting Enchantments (Enchant Spells) are unlocked by a combination of Arcanium Resource, Enchanting/Alchemy/Collar Power, and a Spell-specific UnitStat. The Spell-specific UnitStat is acquired by consuming a Forged Item.
		
		2.1. Step #1
		Whenever you loot Arcanium, you should crush it (Consume it). This will increase your Crushed Arcanium resources by 1. Crushed Arcanium is used to enchant items.
		
		2.2. Step #2
		Your Champion with Forging Power needs to create Forged Items, such as a 'Forged Short Sword'. This is done by casting a Forge Spell, see 'Crafting #Forging' category in your Spellbook (Anvil Icon).
		
		2.3. Step #3
		Your Champion with Enchanting Power (or Alchemy Power for Potions or Collar "Power" for Collars or ...) must then consume the Forged Item, which unlocks a series of Enchant Spells. (e.g. All 'Enchant Short Sword (...)' Spells are unlocked by consuming a Forged Short Sword). Note that no Enchanting Spells will show up as available as long as you don't also have the required Crushed Arcanium.
		
		2.4. Step #4
		Your Champion with Enchanting Power (or Alchemy Power for Potions) can then create a new 'Enchanted Item' (e.g. Short Sword of Bane). This is done by casting an Enchanting Spell, see 'Crafting #Enchanting' category in your Spellbook (Star Icon).
		
		To cast Enchanting I Spells, you need 1 Enchanting Power and 1 Arcanium.
		To cast Enchanting II Spells, you need 2 Enchanting Power and 2 Arcanium of the same type.
		To cast Enchanting III Spells, you need 3 Enchanting Power and 3 Arcanium of the same type.
		To cast Enchanting IV Spells, you need 4 Enchanting Power and 4 Arcanium of the same type.
		To cast Enchanting V Spells, you need 5 Enchanting Power and 5 Arcanium of the same type.
		To cast Enchanting VI Spells, you need 6 Enchanting Power and 6 Arcanium of the same type.
		NOTE1: Arcanium values are halved when enchanting Daggers.
		NOTE2: This is a general pattern, some items do not follow it.
		NOTE3: No Enchanting VI Spells currently available.

		<Title>. Logistics</Title>
		<Image>Caravan1_Medallion.png</Image>
		<TutorialText>
		0. Preamble
		Pioneer Production Effort (Pre-XtraDeconstruct 2.0.d. Resource) redesigned: now Logistics.
		Prevents AI from creating Pioneer Armies.
		Prevents Player from using the Queued Pioneer Exploit.
		
		1. How-to acquire Logistics
		Logistics can be acquired if you build the Expansion Bureau (+2) or the Tower of Dominion (+1). The Expansion Satellite Spell provides +1. Thus, you can only have a total of 4 Logistics, unless you acquire the capacity to build more of these buildings when conquering other Factions. It's also possible to acquire some additional Pioneers over that limit through Quests and other means. AI get an extra Logistics point through the Thinking Machines Advantage, but never casts Expansion Satellite.
		
		2. What to do with Logistics?
		Logistics is not accumulated, it is renewed every Season. Logistics will be displayed beside other Resources at the top of the screen (The white four-wheeled carriage). Existing Pioneers use 1 Logistics until they are killed, disbanded, used to create a City, or used to create an Outpost. Pioneers in training use 1 Logistics while queued; cancelling said Pioneer returns 1 Logistics Resource to the Logistics Total.

	<Tutorial InternalName="Tutorial_X_Xtra_Manual_REF">
		<Title>. Random Event Frequency</Title>
		<Image>.png</Image>
		<TutorialText>
		0. Preamble
		Random Event Frequency is found in World Options Interface.
		Each choice refers to a Denominator value, except for 'Never' which disables Random Events.
		The values are found in X_ElementalDefs.
		
		1. Choices
		Less Often (18000)
		Default (9000)
		More Often (5000)
		
		2. How it works
		An event has a TriggerType value, generally TurnNumber (Season).
		When that TurnNumber is reached, a TriggerChance is computed against the Denominator.
		The result is the probability for the Random Event to take place.
		If the Event doesn't happen, then the PostTriggerChance is computed each subsequent Season.
		
		3. Xtra
		Most TriggerChance have been increased substantially.
		Consequently, the general rules are as follow:
		If Less Often is selected, Random Events occurrence is generally 17%
		If Default is selected, Random Events occurrence is generally 33%
		If More Often is selected, Random Events occurrence is generally 66%
		Additionally, some Events will always happen (1000000) unless 'Never' is selected
		
		4. Special
		Many Xtra Events use the DoNotDisplayStartPopup which creates Hidden Events.
		I DON'T recommend playing Xtra with 'Never' as your Random Event Frequency selection.
		
		5. Limitations
		QuestDef code is not overwritten by Mods, meaning Mods do not supersede Core files.
		The workaround is to give Mods Events a higher TriggerChance, essentially preventing the Core Events from spawning.
		However, most Core Events have a PostTriggerChance, so they may spawn afterward.
		To reduce this occurrence, I recommend disabling CoreRandomEvents.xml by modifying .xml into .NO
		NOTE: As of XtraDeconstruct 2.0.f, it's no longer necessary to disable files if you've followed installation instructions.
