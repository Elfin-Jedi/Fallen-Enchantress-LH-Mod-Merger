		<NPCRecruitmentText>It might have taken a while for me to adjust to my new body but it's hard to argue against having three extra pairs of legs. I can now weave beautiful and intricate webs and for %d gildar, I'll catch plenty of juicy flies for you.</NPCRecruitmentText>
		<Backstory>When the promising young soldier Javayr was asked casually by his superior if he'd feel capable of joining the demanding elite battalion working directly with the fierce Brood Squad, he was honored and accepted without a second of hesitation. The next morning, as he diligently reported for duty at the arranged time and place for his incorporation, he was surprised to be welcomed by civilians, the robed and haughty kind, full of themselves and their arcane powers: Magicians. They greeted him with dulcet tones and softly asked his name. Javayr remembers nothing past that point except the intense golden eyes of one of the Magicians, those inexorable suns reaching into the depths of his mind. As it would happen, due to a horrible bureaucratic mix-up, Javayr's association with the Brood became a permanent one. His letter of summons landed him straight into the clutches of the vivisection handlers, those religious fanatics devoted to the Eight-Legged One. When he awoke several days later, when the drug induced fog clouding his thoughts dissipated, all Hell broke loose. Without the careful conditioning requiring months of preparation, his mind couldn't cope with the change and snapped. He easily broke his restraints, killed the two attending Mages and an innocent orderly and wrecked the lab beyond repair before escaping into the night. After several weeks spent as a wild animal on the run, his rational thoughts slowly reasserted themselves. Oh there were quite a few lapses but Javayr eventually became quite enamored with his powerful, sleek new physique. There was no going back to his former life however, no incorporating the Brood Squad, those Mages would ask for his head. And unlike his legs, he still had only one of those.</Backstory>
