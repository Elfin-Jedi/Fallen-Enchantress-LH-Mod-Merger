Also contains Mentor Mod though that one doesn't work yet. And I included some of my custom sovereigns as champions in a folder named Optional.

There are also some additions of my own, mostly expansions of Xtradeconstruct's stuff to work with the new shards from Demons and Wizards. These include new shard conversion spells, new shard wonders, new Shard Adepts faction strengths, new shards getting shrines that work with Binders, Mediums, Gravetouched & Reanimation Rituals faction strengths, sovereign talents and idols that indvidually give battle, beast, nature, and shadow power. I am not creative with writing lore so they have names like Nature Magic Wonder. I also reused graphics. If anyone wants to contribute, let me know. My Discord is tiara6704.

Installation Instructions:

1. Backup "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\data\English" or whatever your main game directory path is.

2. Copy files from 0_NO in the Mods folder to the data\English folder, replacing the original files.

3. Add files from Additional Files to data\English.

You are done! Launch Game and test.

Note: Custom factions need to use Deorcnysse Secrets faction strength. There are instructions for editing Cult Secret Scrolls (for custom sovereigns) in A_UserGuide in the Xtradeconstruct folder.
