# Fallen-Enchantress-LH-Mod-Merger
Merger of 20 mods. Including Xtradeconstruct - Legacy of Magic & Demons and Wizards.
There are also some additions of my own, I am not creative with writing lore so they have names like Nature Magic Wonder. I also reused graphics. If anyone wants to contribute, let me know.

Installation Instructions:

1. Backup "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FE Legendary Heroes\data\English" or whatever your main game directory path is.

2. Copy files from 0_NO in the Mods folder to the data\English folder, replacing the original files.

3. Add files from Additional Files to data\English.

You are done! Launch Game and test.

Note: Custom factions need to use Deorchynesse Secrets faction strength. There are instructions for editing Cult Secret Scrolls (for custom sovereigns) in A_UserGuide in the Xtradeconstruct folder.

To-do:

Finish re-sorting Assassin & Mage trait trees.
